A phased approach, as suggested by Kovind Panel Report (2023), offers a practical solution, but its success depends on consensus and careful execution.",

Both can deliver timely justice and ease the judicial burden. However, better institutional support and resources are needed to enhance their effectiveness",

        "explanation": "### Approach:\n\n* Introduce the answer by discussing the growth of the cabinet system in India.\n* Present arguments on how this growth has marginalised parliamentary supremacy\n* Conclude by reinforcing the importance of parliamentary supremacy.\n\n### Introduction:\n\nThe cabinet system in India has evolved significantly, emphasising **collective responsibility** and the Prime Minister as **\"first among equals.**\" However, despite **not being explicitly mentioned in the Constitution**, this evolution has sometimes marginalised Parliamentary supremacy.\n\n### Body:\n\n* **Concentration of Power in the Executive:** The cabinet centralises power in the hands of the **Prime Minister** and key ministers. **Justice Nagarathna's 2023 dissent** highlighted the unlawfulness of demonetisation without Parliament's approval.\n* **Reduced Parliamentary Scrutiny:** The cabinet often controls the legislative agenda, diminishing parliamentary oversight, as seen with the **criticism of the 2020 Farm Laws** for lacking proper debate.\n* **Ordinances:** The cabinet can bypass legislative oversight through ordinances, like the **2023 ordinance on Delhi's administrative control,** which was initially enacted without debate.\n* **Parliamentary Committee Limitations:** Recommendations from committees are not binding, allowing the cabinet to ignore them. Only **25% of bills** were referred to committees in the 16th Lok Sabha, compared to **71% in the 15th.**\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nWhile the cabinet system has changed power dynamics, parliamentary supremacy is constitutionally protected with Parliament **retaining essential powers like no-confidence motions (Article 75)**. The repeal of **farm laws in 2021** shows that Parliament can effectively check executive power, highlighting the need for balance between governance and oversight.",

Analyze the pros and cons of merging rural and urban local bodies.\n* **Conclusion:** Summarise the potential benefits of merging local bodies for efficiency while emphasising the need to preserve local identity.\n\n### Introduction\n\nThe Constitution of India establishes local self-governance through the **73rd and 74th Amendments (1992)**, creating **Panchayats for rural areas and Municipalities** for urban areas, including Village, Intermediate, and District Panchayats, along with Municipal Corporations and Municipalities.\n\n![](TEST_IMAGES/UPSC_MAIN_CSE_GS_2024_PAPER_2_Q5_IMG_1.png)\n\n### Body\n\n**Role of local bodies in Good Governance:**\n\n* Local bodies, as recommended by committees like the **Balwant Rai Mehta (1957) and Ashok Mehta (1977),** are crucial for **planning and implementing development projects that address local needs, promoting decentralized governance.**\n* They also benefit from financial resources allocated through the recommendations of **15th Finance Commission** for water supply and sanitation, functioning as **local 'public utilities.'**\n* Local bodies ensure **representation of marginalised groups** with reserved seats and encourage **participatory democracy** through **Gram Sabhas** and Ward Committees.\n\n**Merging the Rural Local Bodies with the ULBs:**\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Pros** | **Cons** |\n| Promotes cohesive growth in peri-urban areas. | Rural issues may be overlooked in favour of urban priorities. Concerns may arise about rural representation if urban populations dominate. |\n| Improves management of the blurring rural-urban distinction caused by urbanisation. | Distinct social characteristics of rural areas may complicate governance. |\n| Larger entities can undertake bigger development projects in a merged system. | Villagers fear that merging with ULBs will lead to higher taxes and loss of MGNREGA benefits, as seen in protests in Tamil Nadu. |\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile merging local bodies can improve efficiency, it risks diminishing local identity.

Union of India (1984)** set the precedent for liberalising access to the courts for social justice causes.\n* **Inaction of Government Authorities:** Growth of PILs can be attributed to the failure of government agencies to address public grievances effectively (bureaucratic delays, corruption etc), leading citizens to approach courts through PILs.\n\n**Growth of PILs Making the SC the World\u2019s Most Powerful Judiciary:**\n\n* **Power to Strike Down Laws:**\n  + In 2021, the Supreme Court declared the **NJAC Act and the 99th Constitutional Amendment unconstitutional and void** (PIL challenging NJAC Act filed in 2015).\n* **Addressing Government Inaction via Judicial Review:**\n  + In M.C. Mehta v. Union of India (1988), the court issued directives to control pollution and improve Ganga's water quality.\n  + In the NEET 2024 paper leak case, the SC denied a retest due to insufficient evidence of compromised exam integrity and expanded the Centre-appointed panel\u2019s scope to review NTA's functioning and recommend reforms.\n* **Wider Interpretation of Rights:**\n  + The SC held the **right to privacy** as an intrinsic part of the right to life and personal libe rty under Article 21 (Puttaswamy case 2017).\n  + The SC recognised the **rights of sex workers to dignity** and expanded the interpretation of the right to life and dignity under Article 21 (Budhadev Karmaskar case 2022).\n* **Sou Motu Powers:**\n  + After the poor handling of the Kolkata Muder-Rape case 2024 by the state govt, the SC took the suo motu cognisance of the incident.\n* **Judicial Activism and Overreach:**\n  + Overturning a colonial-era law by decriminalising homosexuality (Navtej Singh Johar case) and declaring triple talaq as unconstitutional and invalid, upholding gender equality and personal rights (Shayara Bano case 2017).\n  + To curb road accidents, the SC ordered a ban on liquor sales within 500 m of highways (2017).\n\nThough PILs have expanded the ambit of judicial review and have contributed in making the SC one of the world\u2019s most powerful judiciary \u2013 judicial overreach has often been criticised by various stakeholders as excessively interfering in the legislative and executive domains; a practice witnessed seldom in more advanced nations like the US and Australia who also have similar systems in place. \u2018Separation of powers\u2019 must be respected to maintain the spirit of democracy.",

        "explanation": "### Approach:\n\n* Define the threat of terrorism using credible sources and outline the role of the UN Counter-Terrorism Committee (UNCTC)\n* Mention the impact of terrorism, the role and effectiveness of the UNCTC, challenges faced, and suggestions for improvement.\n* Conclude with a future-oriented viewpoint.\n\n### Introduction:\n\nThe **Global Terrorism Index 2024** notes a **22% rise in terrorism-related deaths globally,** the highest since 2017. In response, the UN Security Council's Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) plays a vital role in boosting international cooperation to tackle this issue.\n\n### Body:\n\n**Threat of Terrorism to Global Peace and Security:**\n\n* **Erosion of State Sovereignty:** Weak governments in Afghanistan and Somalia allow the Taliban and Al-Shabaab to thrive.\n* **Economic Impact:** The 9/11 attacks led to **USD 40 billion in U.S. losses,** while the 2015 Paris attacks harmed European tourism.\n* **Humanitarian Crises:** ISIS and conflicts in Syria and Iraq have caused major refugee crises, straining host countries.\n* **Political Tensions:** Terrorism intensifies geopolitical conflicts, notably between India and Pakistan, exemplified by the 2019 Pulwama attack.\n\n**UNSC-CTC and its Effectiveness:**\n\n* Established by Resolution 1373 after the **9/11 attacks** to combat terrorism.\n* It facilitates the implementation of legal frameworks like UNSC **Resolutions 1373** and **1540**, requiring member states to combat terrorism and prevent weapons proliferation.\n* It promotes **capacity-building initiatives,** fosters international collaboration for intelligence sharing, and addresses challenges like cyber-terrorism and social media recruitment with modern strategies.\n\n**Challenges of UNCTC:**\n\n* **Lack of Universal Definition:** Inconsistent definitions of terrorism lead to varied international responses.\n* **Enforcement Issues:** Counter-terrorism efforts in places like **Somalia often lack effectiveness** due to various physical and governance-related hindrances.\n* **Political Complexities:** Veto power, particularly from China, can obstruct consensus on terrorist designations.\n* **Evolving Threats:** New challenges like **cyber-terrorism** and **lone-wolf attacks** are rapidly emerging.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n* Create binding counter-terrorism frameworks.\n* Enhance real-time information sharing on financing and movement.\n* Collaborate with local communities to prevent radicalization.\n* Boost financial and technical aid for developing nations.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile the CTC has advanced in countering terrorism, a proactive approach is vital. Strengthening legal frameworks, enhancing intelligence sharing, and fostering community initiatives will better prepare the international community to tackle evolving threats and bolster global security.",

        "explanation": "### Approach\n\n* Write in brief about the strategic location of Maldives.\n* Discuss how geopolitical and geostrategic importance of Maldives affects global trade and energy flows.\n* Show how external players like China impact India-Maldives relations.\n\n### Introduction\n\nMaldives \u2013 a key part of India\u2019s neighbourhood first policy \u2013 is strategically located in the Indian Ocean along critical maritime routes, defining Maldives\u2019 geopolitical and geo-strategic importance far beyond its physical size.\n\n### Body\n\n**Geopolitical and Geostrategic Importance of Maldives:**\n\n* **Sea Lanes of Communication (SLOCs):** The Maldives has two critical SLOCs at its southern and northern ends, vital for maritime trade between the Gulf of Aden, Gulf of Hormuz, and the Strait of Malacca.\n  + 50% of India's external trade and 80% of its energy imports pass through these SLOCs in the Arabian Sea.\n* **Indian Ocean as India\u2019s Backyard**: The Maldives is crucial for India's role as net security provider in the Indian Ocean due to its strategic location, collaborative defence initiatives, and joint efforts in maritime surveillance and humanitarian assistance.\n\n**Impact of Changing India-Maldives Relationship:**\n\nIn the recent years, there has been a **perceived decline in India-Maldives relations:**\n\n* **Strategic Dynamics:** India's **limited engagement** with the Maldives has enabled China's growing influence through **BRI investments**, threatening India's control over key maritime routes and its maritime security.\n* **Economic Competition**: Due to comparatively **less India\u2019s investment** in Maldives, China with its **chequebook diplomacy** has emerged as a major economic player, directly challenging India's long-standing position as the primary partner in the region.\n* **Diplomatic Strain:** Maldives' balancing strategy, fueled by perceived **Indian 'Big** **Brother syndrome',** complicates India's diplomatic efforts and weakens its influence in the Indian Ocean.\n* **Maritime Security:** China's **submarine and destroyer** deployments, along with new docking facilities in the Maldives and Sri Lanka, pose a direct threat to India's maritime interests.\n* **Terrorism:** **Anti-Indian sentiment** and Maldives' focus on **Islamic values raise** concerns about terrorism, potentially destabilising the region and threatening India's security.\n\n![](TEST_IMAGES/UPSC_MAIN_CSE_GS_2024_PAPER_2_Q20_IMG_1.png)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAmid rising Chinese influence and anti-India sentiment, strengthening India-Maldives relations is essential for regional stability and mutual prosperity. A harmonious partnership will benefit economic development, security, and cultural ties, fostering a more resilient and prosperous future for both countries.",
