        "explanation": "Constitutionalisation of Environmental problem means aligning environmental problem to violation of fundamental rights of individual or community or abrogation of responsibility by government to enforce directive principles so as to impart meaningful decency to environmental problem.\n\nJudicial pronouncement that led to constitutionalisation of environmental problems are:\n\n* **Right to Pollution Free Environment -** In **Subhash Kumar vs. State. of Bihar (1991)** the Supreme Court held that right to life is a fundamental right under Art. 21 of the Constitution and it include the right to pollution free environment. Thus, SC imparted constitutionality to right to pollution free environment.\n* **Polluters Pay Principle-** In **M. C. Mehta vs. Union of India (1986)** The Supreme Court introduced the \u201cprinciple of absolute liability\u201d. This enabled that now hazardous industries will be liable for environmental damage.\n* **Right to Clean Air-** To ensure right of citizens to have clean air, SC introduced Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) in Delhi and NCR region in M. C. Mehta case vs Union of India (2020) which ensured gradually curbing the industrial activities as pollution level peaks.\n* **Right to Compensatory Afforestation-** The SC under it established Compensatory Afforestation Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA) to prevent the misuse of funds raised for afforestation, which inevitably resulted in legislation on the CAMPA Act 2016.\n\nThus, SC as guardian of fundamental rights has effectively employed the provision of laws and judicial pronouncement to protect citizens right to environment as fundamental right under Right to dignified life.",

        "explanation": "The Right of movement and residence throughout the territory of India is one of the most important fundamental rights available to the citizens of India.\n\nArticle 19(1)(d) of the Indian Constitution entitles every citizen to move freely throughout the territory of the country. Moreover, it is available only to the citizens and to shareholders of a company but not to foreigners or legal entities like companies or corporations, etc.\n\nFreedom of movement has two dimensions \u2014 internal and external. Article 19(1)(d) protects only the internal dimension, i.e., the right to move withing the country.\n\nRestrictions on this freedom can only be imposed on two grounds which are mentioned in Article 19(5) of the constitution itself, namely, the interests of the public and the protection of interests of any Scheduled Tribe.\n\nArticle 19(1)(e) provides the right \u201cto reside and settle in any part of the territory of India\u201d to the Indian citizens. Just like Article 19(1)(d), this right is also subject to reasonable restrictions.\n\nHowever, these rights are not absolute. For example, for protecting the interests of the Scheduled Tribes in India, various provisions have been enshrined in the Fifth and Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution. Some of these deal with the limitation or prohibition of the transfer of land in such areas as well as the regulation of the allotment of land.\n\nFurther, in the State of Uttar Pradesh v. Kaushaliya (1963), the Supreme Court held that the right of movement of prostitutes may be restricted on the grounds of public health and in the interest of public morals.\n\nThus, this right, while enhancing the mobility of the Indian citizens, is also subject to certain restrictions that help in maintaining a fine balance between freedoms and rights of the people.",

This was lacking in the previous NCBC.\n* 102nd CAA also inserted a new Article 342A, which brings greater transparency as the Act specified the concurrence of parliament which is mandatory in the amendment of the list of backward classes.\n* In the new NCBC, the focus has shifted from reservation to the development of the backward class and the inclusion of grievance redressal.\n\nHowever, there are some underlying issues like, the recommendation of the NCBC is not mandatory and it has no responsibility to define backwardness.\n\nThus, NCBC is an important commission for social progress.

In 2011, Nandan Nilekani committee recommended the DBT scheme concept. Under DBT, transferring subsidies directly into the accounts of beneficiaries can minimize the duplication frauds and leakages. Some examples of DBT scheme are **PM KISAN YOJANA, M GNREGA Scheme, PAHAL YOJANA** etc.\n\nIn the field of Government delivery system, DBT is a progressive step in many ways such as-\n\n* It prevents duplication fraud of beneficiaries.\n* It provides targeted delivery and reduces the delay time of payments.\n* DBT wipes out intermediaries or middleman culture. It reduces the window for corruption and exploitation of poor beneficiaries.\n* It includes the faster flow of targeted funds and services. By this way, it fulfils the positive aspirations of citizen charter.\n\nThere is no doubt that DBT is a positive milestone in the government delivery system but it has some limitations which need to be addressed. Some of limitations are as follows-\n\n* Many beneficiaries are excluded due to not having access to banking services.\n* Due to lack of financial literacy among the masses, DBT cannot achieve its true potential.\n* Aadhaar card data and biometric data mismatch creates ruckus in service delivery system.\n* There are some networking issues in remote areas and rural areas. These led to a delay in services delivery.\n\n### Way forward\n\n* There is a need for robust technical infrastructure and capacity building.\n* Collaboration and coordination among various government departments is very much needed for swift delivery of services to targeted beneficiaries.\n* Government should run the financial literacy awareness program for harnessing the true potential of Direct Benefit Scheme.\n* There should be a provision of single window redressal platform for all glitches and issues related to direct benefit transfers.",

Moreover, an election petition calling in question an election shall be filed within 45 days from the results declaration date.\n\nThe election of a particular candidate can be declared void if the High Court opines that:\n\n* On the date of his/her election a returned candidate was not qualified or was disqualified to be chosen to fill the seat.\n* Any corrupt practice has been committed by a returned candidate.\n* There was an improper acceptance of any nomination.\n* There has been any improper reception, refusal or rejection of any vote or the reception of any vote which is void.\n* There has been any non-compliance with the provisions of the Constitution or RPA.\n\nCertain remedies are available to the aggrieved parties against the order(s) of the High Court. The aggrieved party can file an appeal to the Supreme Court within 30 days from the order of the High Court.\n\nIn the Azhar Hussain v. Rajiv Gandhi case (1985), the election petition by Azhar Hussain was dismissed both by the High Court and the Supreme Court due to a lack of evidence substantiating the allegation of corrupt practices by the returning candidate.\n\nAn application for a stay on the High Court\u2019s order can be made to the High Court. The Supreme Court can also put a stay on the operation of the order made by the High Court based on the aggrieved party\u2019s appeal.\n\nFor example, in the Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain case (1975). Her election was initially voided by the Allahabad High Court on charges of corrupt practices. She later appealed to the Supreme Court which upheld her election.\n\nThus, the Representation of the People Act, 1951 is crucial for the efficient functioning of the Indian democracy as it enables the conduct of streamlined elections and provides the necessary redressal mechanism to the aggrieved parties involved.",

Hence, if certain circumstances arise, then the Governor can re-promulgate the ordinances after giving answers to some questions of the legislature like about their urgency and absolute needs.",

        "explanation": "Centralisation means concentration of decision making and planning at one unit so as to bring in uniformity in the process. It often means consolidation of power or authority. State autonomy refers to degree of control over resources independent of any central authority. There has been tussle between the national and regional political parties over issues such as development, representation at forums and finances.\n\nPolitical parties are recognised as national parties or state parties depending upon their performance in general election of Lok Sabha or Vidhan Sabha. The conditions for being listed as a national or a state party are specified under the Election Symbols (Reservation and Allotment) Order, 1968.\n\n**National Political Parties favour centralisation**\n\n* To achieve uniformity in goals and objectives of political parties\n* To have better control over party cadre members\n* To achieve uniformity in programme of political parties\n* To better target the public at large\n* To better their chances of winning upcoming elections\n\nHowever, centralisation is generally associated with annihilation of regional parties and regional issues and gives prime importance to issues concerning national security. It often demands obedience, overlook accountability and transparency. Thus, centralisation should not overlook the regional issues like development of region, employment etc.\n\n**Regional parties favour state autonomy**\n\n* Regional parties are formed on the lines of identity, statehood, ethnicity, development.,\n* They are in close proximity with the local issues, needs and demands\n* They are against the bureaucratic bottleneck\n* To fasten the decision making at ground level\n* To better mobilise resources according to the need of population\n* To better their ambition of becoming national parties\n\nRegional parties in India are of opinion that regional issues are different from national issues. However, rise in regional parties has also led to another problem of horse trading of members which has pushed the state\u2019s demand for autonomy and development at backseat for certain political gains. This is unhealthy for any democracy. Thus, it is necessary that demand of regional parties are aligned with unity and integrity of India.",

On the other hand, the President of India is elected by the elected members of Parliament and State Legislative Assemblies.\n* The nomination of President of India requires 50 electors as proposers and 50 electors as seconders, whereas President of France requires 500 elected officials as proposers.\n* The French presidential election is split up into two rounds. In the first round, people can vote for any of the candidates that have gathered the 500 signatures. If no candidate receives an absolute majority, then in second round candidate can vote for only remaining candidate who emerged first and second in first and second round.\n* There is no procedure of security deposits in French Presidential elections unlike Indian Presidential election.\n\nThus, we can say that there are some similarities as well as dissimilarities in election procedure of Presidents India and France. However, the procedure of election may be different but their role as head of the respective republics to embark on the road of growth and development of nation and their ability to maintain social harmony in diverse nation are equally similar.",

        "explanation": "The Election Commission of India (ECI) is an autonomous constitutional body responsible for administering Union and State election processes in India. In the context of free and fair elections, Model Code of Conduct (MCC) plays a crucial role.\n\nThe Model Code of Conduct is a set of guidelines issued by the Election Commission to regulate political parties and candidates prior to elections. MCC is operational from the date on which the election schedule is announced until the date of result announcement.\n\n#### **Evolution of Model Code of Conduct**\n\n* The origins of the Model Code of Conduct lie in the Assembly elections of Kerala in 1960, when the State administration prepared a \u2018Code of Conduct\u2019 for political factors.\n* In the Lok Sabha elections of 1962, the Election Commission of India circulated the code to all recognized political parties and State Governments, and it was followed.\n* In 1991, the Election Commission decided to enforce the Model Code of Conduct more strictly because of repeated flouting of the election norms and continued corruption.\n\n**Role of ECI in the Enforcement of MCC**\n\n* As part of its mandate to conduct free and fair elections under Article 324 of the Constitution, the Election Commission ensures that ruling parties at the Centre and in States adhere to the code.\n* In case of electoral offences, malpractices, and corrupt practices like inducements to voters, bribery, intimidation or any undue influence, the Election Commission acts against violators.\n* The Election Commission has devised several mechanisms for efficient enforcement of MCC such as:   \n  + Joint task forces of enforcement agencies and flying squads.\n  + Introduction of the c-VIGIL mobile app through which audio-visual evidence of malpractices can be reported.\n\nModel Code of Conduct does not have any statutory backing, it has come to acquire strength in the past decade because of its strict enforcement by the Election Commission. The various technological advancement has presented new challenges in the path of ensuring fair elections, but initiatives took by the Election Commission regarding the enforcement of model code of conduct seem to have been fruitful.",

        "explanation": "Donor agencies are the agencies which provide financial help in the developmental process. It may be a national or international agency, like Japan International Cooperation, World Bank, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation etc. In recent times, development processes have been getting dependent on donor agencies for the obvious reason to have easy access to funds.\n\nHowever, this increasing dependence devoid of community participation is fraught with risks. In simple terms, community participation means involving the grassroot level stakeholders in the developmental process.\n\nIn this respect, the following points can be noted that pertain to the working of donor agencies:\n\n* Given the strong financial backing of donor agencies there is less hindrance in the development process. However, they have less accountability in the whole process because they are very objective in nature rather than participatory.\n* In the developmental process, donor agencies can have their own rules related to labour wages and their working conditions. This often reduces community participation to the extent that it even alienates the same communities for which it is vouched.\n* They are more technology-oriented and productivity-focussed. This often causes a decrease in labour force participation. Additionally, donor agencies can also promote favoritism, this means that they help as per their choice not as per need. This can lead to regionally skewed development.\n\nThus, to ensure effective development process, community participation is a must to illustrate, consider the tribal areas. The best way to ensure its development is to involve the tribals by means of manpower contribution, social audit, allowing them to promote their language & culture, promotion of cooperative culture, etc.\n\nIf one gets dependent only on donor agencies then it is like a top-down approach to the development process which can often be away from the ground realities.\n\nThus, Donor agencies are humanitarian but if we get over-dependent on them, then they will ignore domestic or local needs and, in some way, it is like colonialism and this will affect community participation. So, a balanced approach is more suitable in any developmental process between donor agencies and communities.",

By accepting the net-zero commitments, India has reiterated its stand that its policy on climate change is based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.\n\nIndia, since ancient times, has always promoted harmony with nature. This can be further evidenced by the country\u2019s commitment to the Paris Accord and the acceptance of the net-zero targets, proving that India is aware of clean energy\u2019s significance.\n\nIn this context, the five-point agenda of Panchamrit for dealing with climate change, including ambitious targets related to the use of renewable energy for meeting the country\u2019s energy requirements, reduction in carbon emissions and intensity in its economy and achieving the target of net-zero, are a clear statement by India of its commitment towards clean energy as well as its intent for taking a leading role in the same.\n\n* India\u2019s geopolitical and global outlook, based on the constantly evolving global environmental challenges, can be witnessed by the country\u2019s diplomacy at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).\n* India does not agree to the imposition of legally binding targets since it requires strategic autonomy to (a) pursue its domestic developmental agenda and (b) identify the method required to commit to targets related to climate change and clean energy.\n* India, keeping the ambition of enhancing its global profile and power ambitions, has moved away from a reactionary to a participatory approach. This can be seen with India\u2019s change in position from its response to the Kyoto Protocol commitments as compared to the Paris Agreement.\n* Further, keeping in line with its diplomatic endeavours globally and the recognition of clean energy\u2019s significance, India has taken a leading role along with other major global players in several international initiatives such as the International Solar Alliance (ISA), the One Sun, One World and One Grid programme and the Lifestyle for Environment (LiFE) Movement.\n* Further, India has also raised its concerns regarding the reluctance of the developed nations in sharing the necessary technologies with the developing nations to enable them to effectively deal with climate change.\n\nThus, India has modified its climate change policy according to the developments taking place on a global scale and has taken initiatives in mitigating issues arising out of climate change while keeping in mind its geopolitical objectives.",
