India faces a challenging immediate future in energy and climate policy-making. The problems are multiple: sputtering fossil fuel production capabilities; limited access to electricity and modern cooking fuel for the poorest; rising fuel imports in an unstable global energy context; continued electricity pricing and governance challenges leading to its costly deficits or surplus supply; and not least, growing environmental contestation around land, water and air. But all is not bleak: growing energy efficiency programmes; integrated urbanisation and transport policy discussion; inroads to enhancing energy access and security; and bold renewable energy initiatives, even if not fully conceptualised, suggest the promise of transformation.   Which one of the following statements best reflects the critical message conveyed by the passage given above?",

There are reports that some of the antibiotics sold in the market are fed to poultry and other livestock as growth promoters. Overusing these substances can create superbugs, pathogens that are resistant to multiple drugs and could be passed along humans. Mindful of that, some farming companies have stopped using the drugs to make chickens gain weight faster.

Increased emphasis, however, has been placed on a surge in demand for food from the most populous emerging economics. It seems highly probable that mass consumption in these countries could be well poised to create a food crisis.With reference to the above passage, the following assumptions have been made:1.

Your answers to these items should be based on the passage only.A central message of modern development economics is the importance of income growth, by which is meant growth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In theory, rising GDP creates employment and investment opportunities. As incomes grow in a country where the level of GDP was once low, households, communities, and governments are increasingly able to set aside some funds for the production of things that make for a good life. Today GDP has assumed such a significant place in the development lexicon, that if someone mentions economic growth, we know they mean growth in GDP.With reference to the above passage, the following assumptions have been made:1. Rising GDP is essential for a country to be a developed country.2. Rising GDP guarantees a reasonable distribution of income to all households.Which of the above assumptions is/are valid?",

These were exposed to two different types of light - a white light similar to newer commercial LED lights and an amber light similar to sodium street lamps. The low intensity amber light was shown to inhibit, rather than induce, flowering in a wild plant of the pea family which is a source of food for the pea-aphids in grasslands. The number of aphids was also significantly suppressed under the light treatment due to the limited amount of food available.Which one of the following statements best reflects the most critical inference that can be made from the passage given above?",

Pollination is responsible for providing us with a wide variety of food, as well as many plant-derived medicines. At least one-third of the world’s agricultural crops depend upon pollination. Bees are the most dominant taxa when it comes to pollination and they are crucial to more than four hundred crops. Pollination is an essential service that is the result of intricate relationships between plants and animals, and the reduction or loss of either affects the survival of both. Effective pollination requires resources, such as refuges of pristine natural vegetation.On the basis of the passage given above, the following assumptions have been made:1. Sustainable production of India’s cereal food grains is impossible without the diversity of pollinating animals.2. Monoculture of horticultural crops hampers the survival of insects.3. Pollinators become scarce in cultivated areas devoid of natural vegetation.4. ​Diversity in insects induces diversity of plants.Which of the above assumptions is/are valid?",

The idea that one should treat persons with respect not only because. some of these persons possess some special features or talent, for example skilled cricketers, gifted musicians, or literary giants, but because persons are human beings, is by now part of commonsense morality.With reference to the above passage, the following assumptions have been made :1. Equality is a prerequisite for people to participate in the multiple transactions of society from a position of confidence.2. Occurrence of inequality is detrimental to the survival of democracy.3.

Such agricultural mimics, like their natural models, can be productive, pest-resistant, nutrient conserving, and resilient to shocks and stresses. In ecosystems there is no ‘waste’, nutrients are recycled indefinitely. Agroecology aims at closing nutrient loops, i.e., returning all nutrients that come out of the soil back to the soil such as through application of farmyard manure. It also harnesses natural processes to control pests and build soil fertility i.e., through intercropping. Agroecological practices include integrating trees with livestock and crops.Consider the following :1. Cover crops2. Fertigation3. Hydroponics4. Mixed farming5. Polyculture6. Vertical farmingWhich of the above farming practices can be compatible with agroecology, as implied by the passage?",

Hygiene has different levels: personal, domestic and community hygiene. There is no doubt that personal cleanliness brings down the rate of infectious diseases. But the entry of the market into this domain has created a false sense of security that gets conditioned and reinforced by the onslaught of advertisements. Experience in Western Europe shows that along with personal hygiene, general improvements in environmental conditions and components like clean water, sanitation and food security have brought down infant/child death/infection rates considerably. The obsession with hand hygiene also brings in the persisting influence of the market on personal health, overriding or marginalising the negative impact on ecology and the emergence of resistant germs.On the basis of the passage given above, the following assumptions have been made :1. People who are obsessed with personal hygiene tend to ignore the community hygiene.2. Emergence of multi-drug resistant germs can be prevented by personal cleanliness.3. Entry of the market in the domain of hygiene increases the risk of infectious diseases.4. Scientific and micro-level interventions are not sufficient to bring down the burden of infectious diseases.5. It is community hygiene implemented through public health measures that is really effective in the battle against infectious diseases.Which of the above assumptions are valid?",

Your answers to these items should be based on the passages only.Can a democracy avoid being a welfare state for long ? Why cannot mass welfare be left entirely to the markets ? There is a built-in tension between markets and democracy. Markets do not work on a one-person-one-vote principle as democracies do. What one gets out of the market place depends on one’s endowments, skills, purchasing power and the forces of demand and supply. Markets reward individual initiative and skill, and may also lift many from the bottom rungs of society, but some people never get the opportunity to develop skills that markets demand; they are simply too poor and too handicapped; or skill formation takes too long. By creating jobs, markets may be able to help even unskilled people, but capitalism has always witnessed bursts of unemployment.With reference to the above passage, the following assumptions have been made :1. Modern democracies rely on the forces to enable them to be welfare states.2. Markets ensure sufficient economic growth necessary for democracies to be effective.3. Government programmes are needed for those left behind in economic growth.Which of the above assumptions is/are valid ?",

The answer is both simple - save the human life - and complex. At which angle should the car swerve - just enough to save. the jaywalker or more than enough? If the driverless car is in Dublin, who would take the decision? The Irish Government, or the car’s original code writer in California, or a software programmer in Hyderabad to whom maintenance is outsourced? If different national jurisdictions have different fine print on prioritising a human life, how will it affect insurance and investment decisions, including transnational ones?Which of the following statements best reflect the rational, plausible and practical implications that can be derived from the passage given above?1.
