The rise in sea surface temperature is primarily driven by human-induced climate change, with significant contributions from greenhouse gas emissions.**SST** plays a crucial role in influencing weather patterns, especially in the formation of\u00a0 tropical cyclones.\u00a0\n\n![](TEST_IMAGES/UPSC_MAIN_CSE_GS_2024_PAPER_1_Q4_IMG_1.jpg)\n\n### Body\n\n**Impact of SST Rise on Tropical Cyclone Formation :**\u00a0\n\n* **Energy Source:** Rising sea surface temperatures provide the necessary heat and moisture, which are crucial for the formation and intensification of tropical cyclones.\n* **Convection:** Higher SSTs enhance convection processes, leading to the development of tropical cyclones.\n* **Development Threshold:** If SSTs are below the 26\u00b0C threshold, the energy available for cyclone development is insufficient.\n* **Intensity:** Warmer SSTs not only initiate cyclone formation but also contribute to the intensification of existing storms, potentially increasing their wind speeds and destructive capacity.\n* **Frequency:**Rising global temperatures may increase the frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones by raising sea surface temperatures.\n* **Changing Tracks**: As SSTs rise globally, tropical cyclones may form in new regions or shift their paths, affecting areas previously unaffected.\n\n![](TEST_IMAGES/UPSC_MAIN_CSE_GS_2024_PAPER_1_Q4_IMG_2.png)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo safeguard marine ecosystems from rising sea surface temperatures, it is essential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and develop climate-resilient infrastructure. At the same time, conserving marine ecosystems through sustainable practices and improving forecasting capabilities will enhance the region's resilience to extreme weather events.",

This rule stretched over for over five long centuries where Chola art saw culmination of dravida temple art resulting in the most sophisticated buildings.\n\n### Body:\n\n**The uniqueness of Chola temples:**\n\n* High boundary walls of temples with high entrance gateway (gopuram)\n* Circular and Square Sanctums.\n* Stepped pyramid structure (vimana)\n* Crowniang shikhar in an octagon shape\n* Intricate sculptures and inscriptions on walls of temples.\n* The presence of a water tank inside the temple enclosure\n* Pillared mandapams like ardha mandapa.\n\n**Contribution of Chola to Temple Development**\n\n* **More elaborative structures** like Brihadeshwara temple.\n* During the Chola period **stones were used instead of bricks** for making temples.\n* **Gopurams evolved into more exquisite** and well composed structures with carvings and series of effigies on them.\n* Cholas **brought maturity and grandeur to temple** architecture with elaborate pyramidal storeys. Eg. **Shiva Temple in Thanjavur.**\n* Temples have evolved **beautiful shikhara at the top with elaborate meticulous carving.** Eg. **Gangaikondacholapuram temple.**\n* The **dvarapalas at the entrance of the mandapa,** introduced by the Pallavas, became a **unique feature of Chola temples.**\n* The **temples were decorated with artistic stone pillars** with elongated limbs and polished features. Example: Carvings of the wheel chariot in Airavatesvara Temple.\n\n**Cholas Sculpture:**\n\n* **Chola bronze sculptures,** known for their exceptional craftsmanship, were created **using the lost wax technique. Eg. Nataraja Sculpture** in the Tandav posture.\n* The later chola sculpture shows Bhudevi (earth goddess) as the younger consort of Vishnu.\n* **Temple sculptures of Chola had delicate ornamentation**, pleasing faces and certain freshness. **Eg. Brihadisvara temple, Tanjavur.**\n* Independent figurines of **Parvati portray her in the elegant tribhanga posture.**\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe Chola Dynasty\u2019s patronage, grand temples, architectural innovations, and support for sculptural art led to UNESCO recognition of their temples as world heritage sites.",

While it is often argued that the war was fought to preserve the balance of power in Europe, this perspective only partially explains the complex conditions that led to the conflict.\n\n### Body:\n\n**Balance of Power as a Cause:**\n\n* **European Alliances:** Aiming at counterbalancing the power of each other.\n  + **Triple Entente:** Comprised of France, Russia, and the United Kingdom.\n  + **Triple Alliance:** Consisted of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy which sought to maintain their dominance in Europe.\n* **Changing Power Dynamics:**\n  + **Germany\u2019s Rise:** Germany\u2019s rapid industrialization and military expansion was seen as a threat by the other powers.\n    - After war, **winner punished and weaken Germans both financially and territorially and strengthened its weak rival France.**\n  + **Decline of Empires:** Creation of power vacuums and instability due to the weakening of the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian Empires.\n\n**Other Factors:**\n\n* Competitive Imperialism: Before WWI, Africa and parts of Asia were points of contention among the European countries because of their raw materials.\n  + The increasing **competition for the market (Africa) and desire for greater empires** led to an increase in the confrontation that helped push the world into World War I.\n* **Military mobilisation as a strength of nation:** By 1914, Great Britain and Germany both greatly increased their military buildup and navies.\n  + This rise in militarism promoted the idea of mass mobilization as a nation's strength, leading countries into war. Example: **German mass mobilisation towards the Russian border provoked Russia against Germany.**\n* **Nationalism:** The rise of nationalist sentiments **(race/ethnicity as the basis of the nation) across Europe fueled tensions and territorial disputes.** Example: The desire of the Slavic peoples in Bosnia and Herzegovina to be part of Serbia instead of Austria-Hungary.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nWhile the preservation of the balance of power was a significant factor in the outbreak of the First World War, it was not the sole cause.

As per the Central Ground Water Board groundwater levels are declining at an alarming rate of 0.5 to 1 meter per year in this area.\n\n### Body\n\n**Reasons for Declining Groundwater**\n\n* **Rapid Urbanization:** A rise in demand leads to over-extraction of groundwater. Unregulated drilling of borewells is a major cause.\n* **Over-Irrigation:** A problem of abundance, this leads to detereorating soil health as well.\n* **Inadequate Rainwater Harvesting:** Despite abundant monsoons, rainwater is lost instead of replenishing the groundwater.\n* **Climate Change and Erratic Rainfall:** Irregular rainfall patterns, prolonged droughts, and increased evaporation due to rising temperatures hinder groundwater recharge.\n\n**Food Security Amid Crisis**\n\n* **Reduced Crop Yields:** With less groundwater available, farmers will face water shortages for irrigation, especially during dry seasons.\n  + This can lead to lower crop yields for water-intensive crops like rice and wheat, which are staples in India.\n* **Increased Dependence on Rainfall:** As groundwater levels drop, farmers will rely more on unpredictable monsoons.\n  + Making agriculture more vulnerable to droughts and erratic rainfall patterns, resulting in unstable food production.\n* **Higher Costs of Production:** Farmers may need to dig deeper wells or invest in more expensive water extraction methods, raising the cost of cultivation.\n  + This will in turn make food more expensive and less accessible, impacting affordability.\n* **Loss of Livelihoods:** Declining groundwater could force small and marginal farmers to abandon agriculture, reducing agricultural output and threatening rural livelihoods, further affecting food security.\n\n**Addressing Groundwater Decline**\n\n* Promote Efficient Irrigation techniques like **drip and sprinkler irrigation.**\n* Implement **rainwater harvesting** systems in urban and rural areas to recharge groundwater levels.\n* Shift from **water-intensive crops** like rice and sugarcane.\n* Encouraging water efficient and technologically advanced **methods of construction.**\n* **Policy interventions** such as providing **financial incentives** for farmers to adopt water-efficient technologies and practices is required.\n* Proper implementation of river rejuvenation programmes such as Namami Gange, with addition of artificial recharge structures can help recharge groundwater.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe decreasing groundwater potential in the Gangetic Valley threatens India's food security. Immediate actions are essential for sustainable groundwater management and adapting agricultural practices to secure the country's long-term food supply.",

These are visible only at night, and usually only appear in lower polar regions. Auroras primarily appear near the poles of both the northern and southern hemispheres all year round but sometimes they expand to lower latitudes.\n\n### Body\n\n**Types of Aurora**\n\n* **Aurora Australis (Southern Lights):** Visible in the Southern Hemisphere, especially around the Antarctic Circle, in countries like Australia, New Zealand, Antarctica, and southern parts of South America.\n* **Aurora Borealis (Northern Lights):** Seen near the Arctic Circle, caused by solar particles interacting with Earth\u2019s magnetic field and atmosphere. It displays green, red, and purple lights in countries like Norway, Sweden, Finland, Iceland, Canada, and Alaska.\n\n**Auroras are Triggered By**\n\n* **Solar Winds:** Interaction of Solar Wind particles produced by sun with earth magnetic fields trigger auroras.\n* **Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs):** CMEs are huge bubbles of coronal plasma threaded by intense magnetic field lines that are ejected from the Sun over the course of several hours. These can enhance auroral activity by increasing the number of charged particles reaching Earth.\n* **Magnetosphere Disturbances:** It plays a crucial role in triggering auroras. When the solar wind, which consists of charged particles from the Sun, interacts with Earth\u2019s magnetosphere, it causes disturbances.\n* **Atmospheric Interaction:** Charged particles, primarily electrons and protons, are directed towards the polar regions by Earth\u2019s magnetic field. When these particles collide with gases in the upper atmosphere, they excite these gasses, resulting in the emission of light.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAuroras are the outcome of intricate space weather events, showcasing the dynamic interplay between Earth\u2019s magnetic field and solar activity. The recent occurrence of which was seen at Hanle village in Ladakh in the form of aurora borealis.",

Similarly, the Sachar Committee (2006) highlighted that Muslims suffer from educational and economic deprivation, with lower literacy rates and poorer access to government jobs.\n* **Regional and Ethnic Disparities:**\n  + Tribal communities in central India and ethnic groups in the northeast face underdevelopment and displacement due to mining, infrastructure, and industrial projects. For instance, large-scale displacement caused by the Narmada dam disproportionately impacted Adivasi populations.\n* **Linguistic Marginalization:**\n  + Non-Hindi speaking states, particularly in the south, often express concerns over the central government's focus on Hindi, which they argue sidelines regional languages and leads to resource allocation disparities.\n* **Gender and Intersectionality:**\n  + Women from marginalized communities, like Dalit women, face compounded disadvantages in education, healthcare, and employment, experiencing both caste and gender-based discrimination.\n\n**Counter Arguments**\n\n* **Economic Structures:**\n  + Economic forces like globalization, neoliberal policies, and agrarian distress also exacerbate poverty, affecting both marginalized and non-marginalized communities.\n* **Policy and Governance Failures:**\n  + Poor implementation of schemes like MNREGA and PDS leakages further marginalize disadvantaged groups, revealing governance as a major factor beyond cultural identity.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile there is a significant correlation between cultural diversity and socio-economic marginalization, broader economic factors and governance issues also contribute. Addressing both cultural and structural inequalities is essential for achieving socio-economic justice in India.",
