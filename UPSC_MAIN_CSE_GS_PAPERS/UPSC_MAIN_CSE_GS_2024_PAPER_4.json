While AI can enhance efficiency and objectivity, it raises profound ethical questions.\n\n### Body:\n\n![](TEST_IMAGES/UPSC_MAIN_CSE_GS_2024_PAPER_4_Q1_IMG_1.png)\n\n* AI's reliance on data-driven algorithms **diminishes the role of human intuition and ethical reasoning,** resulting in decisions that lack contextual understanding.\n* Determining **responsibility** becomes problematic when AI decisions cause harm, making it unclear whether the fault lies with developers, operators, or the AI itself.\n* AI systems can inadvertently **reinforce biases** present in training data, leading to discriminatory outcomes that disproportionately affect marginalized communities.\n* Many AI algorithms function as \"black boxes,\" making it difficult for stakeholders to grasp the decision-making process, thereby **undermining trust and transparancy.**\n* AI systems often require large amounts of data, raising concerns about **data privacy,** consent, and potential misuse of personal information.\n\nHowever, AI significantly **enhances efficiency and accuracy** in administrative tasks, streamlining processes and boosting citizen satisfaction. Additionally, AI if used properly can improve administration by bringing in **objectivity.**\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nTo harness AI responsibly in administration, it is imperative to address ethical challenges, ensuring that human values, accountability, and social justice are prioritized in decision-making processes.\n\n**(b):**\n\n### Approach:\n\n* Introduce by highlighting the importance of ethics influencing human actions.\n* Mention dimensions of ethics like deontology, teleology and virtue ethics etc and evaluate.\n* Conclude suitably.\n\n### Introduction:\n\nEthics is a framework of principles that guide moral behavior in individuals and organizations. Key dimensions of ethics influence human actions, shaping values and standards that inform decision-making processes, particularly in professional settings where consequences can be significant.\n\n### Body:\n\nThe key dimensions of ethics and their role in shaping ethical decision-making are:-\n\n* **Normative Ethics** establishes moral standards that guide individuals and organizations in evaluating right and wrong actions.\n  + By providing frameworks for navigating moral dilemmas, it significantly shapes decision-making processes.\n* **Virtue Ethics** emphasizes the importance of moral character and the cultivation of virtues such as honesty and courage.\n  + This focus encourages professionals to develop good habits, fostering ethical behavior and creating a collaborative, trustworthy organizational culture.\n* **Deontological Ethics** asserts that certain actions are inherently right or wrong, highlighting the importance of duties and obligations.\n  + It guides professionals to uphold rights and ethical standards, ensuring integrity even under pressure.\n* **Teleological Ethics** evaluates actions based on their outcomes, motivating professionals to consider the broader impact of their decisions.\n  + This perspective promotes practices that benefit both business interests and society.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGandhi's \"Seven Sins\" highlight key ethical dimensions: wealth without work emphasises normative ethics, pleasure without conscience reflects virtue ethics, and knowledge without character underscores integrity. These principles guide individuals and organisations toward responsible behaviour in personal and professional contexts.",

By learning from others and filtering that knowledge through our own experiences, we cultivate authenticity and resilience.\n  + **E.g,** Mahatma Gandhi drew on teachings from **Jesus and Leo Tolstoy** to develop his philosophy of **Satyagraha.**\n* **Societal level:** The quote emphasises that cultures evolve by selectively adopting beneficial elements from others, enriching society while **preserving local identity** and harmonizing external influences with traditional customs.\n  + **Example:** The Indian music industry harmonizes **Western influences with traditional regional sounds,** creating a unique fusion that reflects the diverse cultural heritage of India. **Global brands** like McDonald's adapt to local tastes with items like the **McAloo Tikki Burger,** and the **internationalization of yoga** illustrates this harmonious blend.\n* **National level:** The quote emphasizes that countries should learn from global innovations and adapt them to their unique contexts.\n  + **E.g, The Digital India initiative** exemplifies globalisation tailored to Indian needs by using global technologies to improve **digital literacy and internet access** in rural areas.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSwami Vivekananda\u2019s quote advocates for a harmonious balance between learning from others and celebrating one\u2019s own heritage, leading to a more enriched and authentic life.\n\n**(b):**\n\n### Approach:\n\n* **Introduction:** Highlight the importance of the interplay between faith and strength.\n* **Body:** Discuss the relevance of faith and strength in various contexts.\n* **Conclusion:** Emphasize synergy between faith and strength for achieving meaningful goals.\n\n### Introduction\n\nSardar Patel\u2019s quote highlights the interplay between faith and strength in achieving goals: faith offers vision, while **strength provides the resilience to pursue it. Without strength, faith is just aspiration**; without faith, strength lacks purpose.\n\n### Body\n\n**Relevance of Faith and Strength's Interplay in the Present Context:**\n\n* For a Public Servant, faith provides a vision for a better society, while strength ensures dedication to implement reforms **without corruption.** Both are essential for effective progress.\n  + E.g., **Sardar Patel's** vision of a **unified India** emerged through diplomatic strength, while **Nelson Mandela's** faith and activists' strength ended **apartheid,** leading to a free South Africa.\n* Social Movements like **Black Lives Matter** and environmental activism demonstrate how a **strong belief in justice (faith)** must be matched by the organizational strength to drive change.\n* Successful **entrepreneurs** embody this interplay, as their vision (faith) must be matched with resilience and strategic execution (strength) to overcome setbacks in competitive markets.\n  + E,g., Elon Musk's faith in electric vehicles and reusable rockets highlights how belief and strength help him overcome challenges and achieve his ambitious vision.\n* Nations advance through shared faith and effective reforms. The **Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam philosophy** promotes global harmony, as seen in India's **Vaccine Maitri initiative** and programs like **Swachh Bharat Abhiyan** and the **SDGs.**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy developing both qualities, we can overcome challenges and reach our goals and to achieve greatness, we must recognize faith and strength as essential foundations for success.\n\n**(c):**\n\n### Approach:\n\n* **Introduction:** Emphasize the distinction between legal and ethical culpability.\n* **Body:** Highlight the relevance of conscience in ethical consideration in present context citing examples.\n* **Conclusion:** Emphasize the importance of personal responsibility and ethical intentions.\n\n### Introduction\n\nImmanuel Kant's quote highlights the distinction between legal and ethical culpability. The law focuses on actions that violate others' rights, while ethics consider intentions and thoughts. An action may be legal but still morally wrong if it has malicious intent.\n\n### Body\n\n**Relevance in Present Context:**\n\n* **Role of Conscience:** Conscience is the inner sense of right and wrong that guides moral decisions. It is essential for upholding ethical standards by prompting individuals to **prioritise others' welfare over personal gain**, even when legal obligations allow otherwise. A strong conscience **fosters accountability and ensures actions** align with moral principles.\n  + E.g, a **whistleblower** reports unethical practices, prioritizing public good over job security due to their strong conscience.\n* **Corporate Responsibility:** Corporates might legally avoid taxes through loopholes, but ethically, this could be seen as **wrong if the intent is to evade fair contribution to society.**\n* **Digital Era:** Hate speech and online trolling often evade legal punishment but carry serious ethical consequences, highlighting the need for urgent attention to their impact.\n* **Workplace Ethics:** An employer might legally follow all labour laws, but ethically, they could be at fault if they exploit workers or create a toxic work environment.\n\nHowever, Kant's view is challenged by evolving ethics; for instance, **adultery** is now decriminalized in India but remains widely regarded as unethical.\n\nThus, Kant's insight encourages us to cultivate a sense of moral responsibility that transcends legal obligations, urging individuals to consider the implications of their thoughts.",

        "explanation": "**(a):**\n\n### Approach:\n\n* Introduce by mentioning that just and unjust are context-dependent.\n* Use examples like Sati abolition, women's roles, caste discrimination, and legal reforms.\n* Ongoing scrutiny ensures evolving justice.\n* Conclude Positively.\n\n### Introduction:\n\nThe concepts of **just and unjust** are shaped by **societal values, cultural norms, modernization, economic shifts, and political changes** can redefine these notions. What was deemed just in one era can shift with changing contexts, necessitating ongoing scrutiny to ensure fair and equitable outcomes in society.\n\n### Body:\n\nThe concepts of just and unjust require constant scrutiny to prevent injustice -\n\n* The 19th-century abolition of the Sati system marked a shift, recognizing harmful practices as unjust.\n* Historically seen as just, the role of women as housewives is now challenged by contemporary views advocating for gender equality and career opportunities.\n* Once accepted, caste-based discrimination is increasingly viewed as unjust and various provisions have been inflicted to mitigate the impact of this injustice.\n* The 2018 decriminalization of homosexuality reflects changing societal values, affirming LGBTQ+ rights previously marginalized.\n* The 2019 ban on triple talaq represented a step toward justice for Muslim women, challenging outdated and unjust practices.\n\nConstant scrutiny of changing contexts is essential to ensure that our understanding of justice evolves with societal values. This vigilance helps prevent outdated practices from perpetuating injustice and promotes equitable treatment for all individuals, fostering a fair and just society.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe shifting nature of justice requires continuous examination of societal contexts. For example, capital punishment, once deemed just in ancient times, is viewed as unjust today. Similarly, the varying marriage ages 18 for girls and 21 for boys reflect current norms.\n\n**(b):**\n\n### Introduction:\n\n* Approach:\n* Introduce the answer by highlighting the difference between form and substance.\n* Explain negative consequences of strict adherence to form, with a brief example.\n* Highlight importance of substance in decision-making, illustrating a relevant case.\n* Describe qualities of a perceptive civil servant (discernment, empathy, moral courage).\n* Conclude suitably.\n\n### Introduction\n\nThe tension between form and substance is critical in administrative processes. Strict adherence to procedures can cause injustices, while an insightful civil servant prioritizes substance over form, ensuring fair outcomes that reflect the law's true intent.\n\n### Body:\n\n1. **Overemphasis on Rules:** Strict adherence to bureaucratic procedures can overshadow the actual needs of citizens, as seen in cases where applications are rejected due to minor technicalities rather than substantive issues.\n2. **Judicial Discretion:** Judges who focus solely on legal formalities may deliver unjust verdicts, while those who consider the broader context can achieve equitable outcomes, such as leniency in sentencing based on mitigating circumstances.\n3. **Social Welfare Programs:** Implementation of welfare schemes often suffers when officials prioritize paperwork over community needs, resulting in essential services being delayed or denied.\n4. **Discretionary Powers:** Civil servants using discretion wisely can adapt policies to suit specific situations, promoting justice, as illustrated by interventions in cases of domestic violence where standard procedures might fail to protect victims.\n\nA rigid **Code of Conduct** is essential for civil servants, defining expected behaviors. In contrast, the Code of Ethics provides moral principles that ensure just outcomes by aligning actions with the law's true intent.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nInstilling the Nolan Principles in civil servants, we can shift their focus from the letter to the spirit of the law. This approach fosters empathy and compassion, ensuring justice aligns with the true intent of regulations.",

You are the Chief Executive Officer and the majority shareholder of this company. The fast technological improvements have raised worries among environmental activists, regulatory authorities, and the general public over the sustainability of this scenario. You confront substantial issues about the business\u2019s environmental footprint. In 2023, your organization had a significant increase of 48% in greenhouse gas emissions compared to the levels recorded in 2019. The significant rise in energy consumption is mainly due to the surging energy requirements of your data centers, fuelled by the exponential expansion of Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI-powered services need much more computational resources and electrical energy compared to conventional online activities, notwithstanding their notable gains. The technology\u2019s proliferation has led to a growing concern over the environmental repercussions, resulting in an increase in warnings.**  \n**All models, especially those used in extensive machine learning and data processing, exhibit much greater energy consumption than conventional computer tasks, with an exponential increase.

However, there are a few pockets in certain states where naxalite problem still persists, mainly due to involvement of foreign countries. Rohit is posted as SP (Special Operations) for the last one year, in one of the districts which is still affected by the naxalite problem. The district administration has taken a lot of developmental works in the recent past in the naxalite affected areas to win the hearts and minds of the people. Over a period of time, Rohit has established an excellent intelligence network to get the real time information regarding the movement of naxalite cadre. To instill confidence in the public and have moral ascendancy over the naxalites, a number of cordons and search operations are being conducted by the police. Rohit, who himself was leading one of the contingents got a message though his intelligence source that about ten hard core naxalites were hiding in a particular village with sophisticated weapons. Without wasting any time, Rohit reached the target village with his team and laid out a foolproof cordon and started carrying out a systematic search. During the search, his team managed to overpower all the naxalites along with their automatic weapons. However, in the meantime, more than five hundred tribal women surrounded the village and started marching towards the target house. They were shouting and demanding the immediate release of insurgents since they are their protectors and saviours. The situation on the ground was becoming very critical as the tribal women were extremely agitated and aggressive. Rohit tried to contact his superior officer, IG (Special Operations) of the state on the radio set and on mobile phone, but failed to do so due to poor connectivity Rohit was in great dilemma since out of the naxalites apprehended, two were not only hard core top insurgents with prize money of ten lakhs on their heads, but were also involved in a recent ambush on the security forces. However, if he did not release the naxalites, the situation could get out of control since the tribal women were aggressively charging towards them.
