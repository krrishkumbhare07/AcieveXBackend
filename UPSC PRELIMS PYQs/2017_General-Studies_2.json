Competition over  these diminishing resources would ensue in the form of political or  even violent conflict. Resource- based conflicts have rarely been   overt and are thus difficult to isolate. Instead they take on veneers that appear more politically palatable. Conflicts over resources like water are often cloaked in the guise of identity or ideology.",

Political legitimacy here means a mass demand from below for the decentralization process, which is able to create a political  force for it to take place.

Your answers to these items should be based on the passages only.    PASSAGE-1  An air quality index (AQI) is a way to combine measurements of multiple air pollutants into a single number or rating. This index is ideally kept constantly updated and available in different  places The AQI is most useful when lots of pollution data are being gathered and when pollution levels are normally, but not  always, low. In such cases, if pollution levels spike for a few days, the public can quickly take preventive action (like staying indoors)  in response to an air quality warning. Unfortunately, that is not  urban India. Pollution levels in many large Indian cities are so high  that they remain well above any health or regulatory standard for  large part of the year. If our index stays in the 'Red/Dangerous'  region day after day, there is not much any one can do, other than  getting  used to ignoring it.",

During hurricane 'Mitch'  in 1998, farms using ecoagricultural practices suffered 58 per  cent, 70 per cent and 99 per cent less damage in Honduras,  Nicaragua and Guatemala, respectively, than farms using conventional techniques. In Costa Rica, vegetative windbreaks and fencerows boosted farmers' income from pasture and coffee while also increasing bird diversity. Bee pollination is more effective when agricultural fields are closer to natural or seminatural habitat, a finding that matters because 87 per cent of the world's 107 leading crops depend on animal pollinators. In Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Colombia silvopastoral systems that integrate trees with pastureland are improving the sustainability of cattle production,  and diversifying and increasing farmers' income.",
