        "explanation": "Recently the Supreme Court\u00a0 struck down the 99th constitutional amendment and held the view that NJAC (National Judicial Appointment Commission) is not a credible alternative to the Supreme Court\u2019s collegium system of appointment of judges for the higher judiciary.\n\nThe court held that the primacy of judiciary in the appointment of judges was part of the basic structure of the Constitution and that the parliament, through NJAC act, violated this basic structure by giving executive and civil society a say in these appointments.\n\nHowever this judgement faced criticism based on following arguments-\n\n* The verdict upheld an extra-constitutional forum, created by the Supreme Court\u2019s own members to serve its own ends, in the place of a system lawfully enacted by a popularly elected Parliament.\n* According to critics, the judgement failed to adequately answer the fundamental question at the root of the controversy, i.e. how is judicial primacy in making appointments to the higher judiciary a part of our Constitution\u2019s basic structure. Whereas the Constitution accords to the President the power to appoint judges with compulsorily consulting with certain persons.\n* Critics say that the Supreme Court, in the second judges\u2019 case, 1993, wrongly interpreted the word \u2018consultation\u2019 used in Articles 124 and 217, to mean concurrence. The court then held that the executive was bound by the advice of the CJI in making appointments to the higher judiciary.\n\nEven the Supreme Court has admitted in the same NJAC judgement that all is not well within the opaque\u00a0 collegium system of \u201c judges appointing judges\u201d and called for further discussion on reform process of collegium system.\n\nThe Constitution envisages and puts a system in place to ensure the balance of power involving the executive, the legislature and the judiciary but not at the cost of opaqueness in appointment process.

The Election Commission has also supported the idea of holding simultaneous elections. \u201cSimultaneous Elections\u201d broadly means structuring the Indian election cycle in a manner that elections to Lok Sabha and State Assemblies are synchronized together.\n\n**Benefits of simultaneous election**\n\n* The 79th Report of the Department related Parliamentary Committee has justified the simultaneous conduct of polls on several grounds, including a huge cut in expenditure incurred for conduct of separate elections every year.\n* Frequent elections lead to imposition of Model Code of Conduct (MCC) over prolonged periods of time and puts on hold the entire development programme and activities of the Union and State Governments in the poll bound State. Simultaneous election will help in limiting amount of time in electioneering.\n* Simultaneous elections would also reduce pressure on manpower and resource deployment necessary for conduct of elections.\n\n**Concerns regarding reducing the government\u2019s accountability to the people**\n\n* Assembly elections are fought on local issues and parties and leaders are judged in the context of their work done in the state. Clubbing them with the general election could lead to a situation where the national narrative submerges the regional story and dilutes the accountability of state leadership.\n\nTherefore, while the idea of simultaneous elections does hold merit, due consideration should be given to both its benedicts and demerits before a decision is taken.\n\nSimultaneous elections are desirable provided they are juxtaposed with certain reforms that would require a prior political consensus to bring a constitutional amendment to curtail or raise term of some states to enable EC to synchronize poll schedule, raise necessary resources of EC such as EVMs, personnel, etc.",

Despite being unstructured and having limited access to financial resources, these groups have proven to be much more impactful than otherwise thought possible. The issue around which they are centered resonates and connects with people cutting across religions, castes, languages and gender \u2013 resulting in the group taking the shape of a movement. This was seen in the cases of:\n\n* Nirbhaya movement which led to changes in the Vishakha guidelines, setting up of Justice Verma committee and also an amendment in the Juvenile Justice Act.\n* India against corruption movement which led to the Lokpal Act.\n\nBoth of these movements were informal, not associated to any identities or entities \u2013 but were issue based, yet led to legislative action at the Centre.",

        "explanation": "India is one of the developing countries that has come out with WASH schemes to address the challenges of health and sanitation in urban and rural areas. Swachh Bharat Abhiyan for urban and rural areas is one of the manifestation of the importance of WASH schemes.\n\nThere has been huge disparities in access to WASH services across different segments of the population. In India, around 128 million lack safe water services and about 840 million people don\u2019t have sanitation services. Thus there is an urgent need to identify the different kinds of beneficiaries and communities whose accesss to WASH services need to be enhanced. The outcomes need to be enhanced in terms of adequacy, accessibility, affordability, quality and safety of the WASH services.\n\nWASH sectors come under concurrent subjects and both central and state governments can legislate on it. The collection of data related to WASH schemes are generally done at state level but it suffers from many discrepancies. The needs and barriers for segments of the population differ and consequently the strategies also need to be customised for the different segments. Therefore, policymakers are gradually moving away from a \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach to a more beneficiary-centric approach.\n\nA traditional approach has been to segment the beneficiaries on the basis of geographical and social context (GSS). Population was therefore segmented as rural, urban, low income and so on. Recently there is a trend to segment the beneficiaries on the basis of the human life cycle (LCS). Beneficiaries are thus segmented as children, adolescents, adults, senior citizens, and so on.  \nTo be able to achieve our WASH targets, it is important that our policies adopt both the LCS and GSS approaches.",

Main provisions of the act that ensure inclusion and empowerment are enumerated below\u2013\n\n* The act aims towards more inclusive coverage of the disabled population by increasing the types of disability from existing 7 to 21. Speech and Language Disability and Specific Learning Disability have been added for the first time. Acid Attack Victims have been included.\n* Every child with benchmark disability (at least 40% of the specified disability) between the age group of 6 and 18 years has been given the right to free education. It also recognises the right of a disabled child to study in a main stream school.\n* Additional benefits such as reservation in higher education (not less than 5%), government jobs (not less than 4 %), reservation in allocation of land, poverty alleviation schemes (5% allotment) etc. have been provided for persons with benchmark disabilities\u00a0 and those with high support needs.\n* Stress has also been given to ensure accessibility in public buildings in a prescribed time-frame.\n\nThis act stresses the principles of non-discrimination, full and effective participation and inclusion in society, equality of opportunity, accessibility and respect for the evolving capacities of children with disabilities. Emphasis has been given to right based approach with focus on right to equality and opportunity, right to inherit and own property, right to home and family and reproductive rights among others.\n\nThe act has also been criticised as it misses on special provision to assist persons with mental illness. Many states also could not frame rules under the act within the stipulated time limit. In absence of rules, several key provisions of the act could not be enforced.\n\nWhile the 2016 Act provides many reassurances, brings domestic law in consonance with international standards, and is a huge step forward, its implementation should be monitored carefully to ensure that the needs of persons suffering from disability issues are being comprehensively met.",

It was felt that it would address the dual need of the employment and food.\n* The accessibility issue of food was assured by Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) introduced in 1997. Better targeting ensured reduction in levels of poverty and hunger.\n* More recently, employment generation programmes like MGNREGA and DeendayalAntyodaya Yojana have met with unprecedented success in improving livelihood of the people.\n\nBut the challenges still remain.\u00a0 According to the latest Global Hunger Index (2017), India got a lowly 100th position out of 119 countries.

GST is one of the biggest indirect tax reforms in India.\n\n**Salient Features of the Act**\n\n* It **amalgamates a large number of Central and State taxes** (like Central Excise Duty, Countervailing Duty, Service Tax, value added tax, octroi etc) into a single tax.\n* It **inserts a new Article 246A** in the Constitution to give the central and state governments the concurrent power to make laws on the taxation of goods and services.\n* Only the centre may levy and collect an **integrated GST** in the course of inter-state trade \u2013 to be divided between the centre and the states.\n* It provides for the constitution of a **GST Council** to develop a harmonized national market of goods and services.\n* It makes provision for **compensation to states for revenue losses** arising out of the implementation of the GST.\n\n**Cascading Effect of Taxes**\n\nGST follows a **multi-stage collection mechanism** in which tax is collected at every stage and the credit of tax paid at the previous stage is available as a set off at the next stage of transaction. This means that tax paid on inputs is deducted from the tax payable on the output produced **(input tax credit)**. This is expected to mitigate the ill effects of cascading. However, the effectiveness of this will depend on the level of digital literacy of the traders and the efficient functioning of the GST Network (GSTN).\n\n**\u2018One Nation, One Tax and One Market\u2019**\n\nGST aims to make India a common national market through:\n\n* **uniform tax** **rates** and procedures, and\n* **removal of hurdles in inter-State transactions** as only IGST will be applied on inter-State trade.\n\nHowever, the efficaciousness of a uniform market is hindered by multiple tax slabs (0%, 5%, 12%, 18% and 28%), **tax exemption to real estate, petroleum and alcohol,** and **exclusion of the informal or unorganizedeconomy** which accounts for nearly 50% of India\u2019s gross domestic product.\n\nAny new reform is expected to experience a few teething problems. Since it is expected to be beneficial to the Indian economy in the long-term, the gradual course-corrections should continue\u00a0 to ensure that it is able to meet its intended objectives.",

        "explanation": "In a recent judgement Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court has expanded the scope of Fundamental Rights further by ruling that right to privacy is intrinsic to right to life and personal liberty under article 21 and is inherently protected under the various fundamental rights enshrined under Part III of the Indian Constitution.\n\nThe judgement will amplify the scope of fundamental rights in the following ways-\n\n* The concept of privacy is embedded in the right to liberty/dignity and that everything done in the exercise of freedom could be attributed to privacy. Therefore different kinds of\u00a0 freedom guaranteed under article 19 will also get amplified and all the legislative acts and executive actions will have to meet the rigours of right to privacy.\n* Similarly, right to equality under article 14 can only be exercised through liberty and freedom of choice.\n* Sexual orientation is a part of the right to privacy and thus the judgement may cast doubts over the legality of Section 377 of the IPC. It may open up a new era of liberty for homosexual individuals and acceptance of same sex marriage in India.\n* Three elements are considered as the core to the right to privacy: Personal autonomy, the freedom to make choices and the right to determine what happens with information about oneself. It will question the Aadhaar scheme, being enforced by the government to avail different kinds of public services. Although the constitutional validity of the Aadhar scheme is yet to be decided by the Constitutional Bench of the Supreme Court.\n\nHowever it should not be forgotten that no fundamental rights are absolute in India and therefore right to privacy will also be guided by the same. Different limitations has been imposed by the constitution itself on the exercise of the fundamental rights. Thus right to privacy will be tested on case-to-case basis. However, the\u00a0 judgement of the Supreme Court will open a new path for securing the privacy, liberty, equality and dignified life for the common man. It will also be helpful in creating a robust legal framework for privacy in India.",

        "explanation": "National Commission for Women is a statutory organization formed in 1992. It is mandated to review the constitutional and legal safeguards for women; recommend remedial legislature measures; facilitate redressal of grievances and advise the Government on all policy matters affecting women.\n\nSince its inception, the Commission has occupied a considerable space in protecting the rights of weaker section of the population on gender lines. In the past, it has proposed the amendments to the acts such as IPC, 1860 to curb the sale of minor girls, Hindu Marriage Act 1955 to omit epilepsy as grounds for divorce, Dowry Prohibition Act in order to bring the problems of Dowry deaths in to the lime light and deal with them appropriately etc. It also proposed the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Bill which was passed in 2005.\n\nIn recent times, the Commission has adopted the multi-pronged strategy of assisting women in redressal of their grievances, facilitating speedy delivery of justice to women by organising ParivarikMahila Lok Adalats in different parts of the country as well as launching the awareness campaign regarding women\u2019s rights. Recently, the Commission set up several inquiry committees to combat problems faced by women such as in the case of police atrocities and misbehavior with girl students of Kurukshetra University, rape case of a women in Safdarjung Hospital, gangrape of 15 years old girl at Lucknow etc. Further, its Research Cell looks into the emerging problems of Indian women due to discrimination and gender bias.\n\nHowever, there are also examples when the Commission has not been able to come up to the expectations of women in India. For example - on the other serious issue of use of sexual violence against women by police and army personnel in the highly militarised areas of Jammu and Kashmir, north-east and now Chhattisgarh, there has been a silence on this on the part of the commission. Also, the commission has been limited in its fight for empowering Indian women due to shortcomings in its composition and structure:\n\n* It only recommends amendments and submits reports which are not binding on the government\n* It lacks autonomy in terms of appointment of its own members.\n* It is depended on the government for funding which compromises its independence.\n* Its jurisdiction is not applicable to Jammu and Kashmir where the violence against women has increased in the recent past.\n\nThus there is a need to safeguard the political autonomy of NCW by replacing the current nomination system with a transparent, democratic and non-partisan selection process for members and chairperson of the commission. It should also be given the wider power to enforce its recommendations and provide immediate relief to the victim of women discrimination and violence.",

However, the effectiveness of these programs has always been questioned. Below Poverty Line card, traditionally the main point of access to government welfare schemes has turned out to be a failure. According to reports as many as half of India\u2019s poor households do not even possess a BPL card as their allocations have been discretionary.\n\nThe plethora of programmes that have been launched by the various departments, more or less for the same objective, covering by and large the same target group in the same area, has created quite a bit administrative confusion. Another weakness in the implementation side relates to the lack of political will which is quite obvious in the rural development area. The main point of deficient implementation can be summarized as under:\n\n* Half-hearted implementation of the programme\n* Lack of political commitment or strong leadership behind it\n* Faulty administrative structure and also its incapability in translating policy into programmes and plans into action\n* Limited ways of checking corruption and leakages that diverts the flow of benefits.\n\nHowever, not all can be termed a failure. For instance, NREGA, another flagship scheme is universalistic by design, promises employment and a guaranteed income to households. It has been hailed by politicians and experts alike.\n\n**Causes of failure**\n\n* There is no systematic attempt to identify people who are in poverty, determine their needs, address them and enable them to move above the poverty line.\n* There is no commitment by the government to support an individual or a household for getting minimum level of subsistence through any program.\n* The resources allocated to anti-poverty programs are inadequate.\n* There is no method to ensure that programs reach everybody they are meant for.\n\nAs things stand, many of those living in poverty today will continue to remain poor over time.

There is a marked lack of citizen-centric approach which is essential to understand and redress problems of the poor and the weaker sections.\n* Lack of stability of tenure due to government\u2019s inherent right to transfer a civil servant prevents the incumbent to learn on the job, develop his/her own capacity and then contribute in the best possible manner.\n* Political interference in the form of arbitrary and whimsical transfers to ensure administrative acquiescence prevents the civil servant from acting neutrally.\n* Promise of post-retirement appointments to statutory commissions, quasi-judicial tribunals, constitutional authorities or contesting election for a political office on the ticket of a political party prevent the civil servant from acting impartially.\n* Promotions hinge on several factors such as patronage versus merit.\n\nTherefore, the purpose of \u2018reform\u2019 is to reorient the civil services into a dynamic, efficient and accountable apparatus for public service delivery built on the ethos and values of impartiality, neutrality and effectiveness.

Despite India\u2019s efforts to develop its domestic energy capacity, it is dependent on imports for 80% of its oil needs, of which roughly 55% is sourced from the Persian Gulf region and more than 80% of gas supplies. This highlights the need for energy policy cooperation with the resource rich West Asian countries. Consequently, India has adopted a \u2018Look West\u2019 or \u2018Link West\u2019 policy in this regard.\n\nSaudi Arabia is India\u2019s second largest source of oil. Iraq is also a major source of Indian energy imports. Further, the energy imports from Iran picked up in the recent past after the easing of sanctions by US. India has also enhanced its bilateral engagement with countries like Oman and UAE and also at institutional level with GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council).\n\nThough countries such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iran, Iraq and Qatar will continue to be its major suppliers of oil and gas, India is trying to walk the diplomatic tight rope in West Asia by partnering with Israel in its Leviathan natural gas filed in the East Mediterranean Sea.\n\nIndia\u2019s energy relation with West Asian countries are intricately related with the Central Asian countries. Thus India has developed Chabahar port in Iran to access the Central Asian energy market. Besides energy infrastructure projects like TAPI gas pipeline and International North South Corridor will have ripple effects on the India\u2019s energy engagements with the West Asian Nations.\n\nIndia\u2019s energy policy engagement with the West Asian region is also related to providing maritime security in the region as most of the shipping vessels pass through Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. Other major powers like China have increased its footprint in the region. Thus India must also take stock of this geopolitical game in order to secure its own energy security.",
