        "explanation": "A **sculpture** is not only ornamental. To depict the **politics, culture, history, religion, rituals,** and **memorial homages** of the area, sculpture is utilized in a variety of circumstances. The work changes across time and space since it is a tactile creative form that exists in the same space as its audience. Sculptural forms, whether bronze busts, spectacular statues, or sophisticated stone carvings, represent accurate images and ideas from ancient cultures.\n\n* One of the most prevalent messages is that a sculpture communicates about a civilization\u2019s belief in certain forms of religion.\n* During the early phase of **Buddhism**, Buddha is depicted symbolically through **footprints, stupas, lotus throne, chakra** etc. This indicates either **simple worship or paying respect** or at times depicts historicizations of life events.\n  + The Jataka stories also became equally important for sculptural decorations.\n  + The motif of the chakra becomes significant as a representation of the **Dhammachakra** in the entire Buddhist art.\n  + The wheel represents the Dharma, the teachings of the Buddha. In the center of the wheel are three swirls that represent the three jewels of Buddhism, which are the **Buddha (or the teacher), the Dharma (teachings of Buddha)**, and the sangha (the community).\n  + The **Dharmachakra** takes the **form of a wheel** to represent the **completeness of the Dharma.**\n* **The sculptures, carved panels,** and **open pavilion style temples of Gurjara-Pratihara** are well-known.\n* The most significant advancement in their **temple-building style** occurred at **Khajuraho**, which is now a **UNESCO World Heritage Site.**\n  + The design, structure, and placement of the building's components are symbolic and represent the **core Hindu values.**\n* The most important places in **Rajasthan** where sculptural activity continued to be in progress were **Vasantgarh, Devangarh, Palta, Osian, Dilwara, Chittor, Mandor etc.**\n* **The Gurjara Pratiharas** had a vast kingdom that embraced the territory of **Gujarat, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh.** Their rule in the 8th, 9th and 10th centuries saw a great cultural renaissance.\n  + **Mahishasuramardini in relief, Girigovardhana panel, Arjuna's penance or the Descent of the Ganga, Trivikrama Vishnu, Gajalakshmi and Anatasayanam** are the few prominent sculptures which represent the faith and belief of the society.\n* The **sculptural tradition** in **Gandhara** had the confluence of **Bactria, Parthia** and the **local Gandhara tradition** which reveals the structure and tradition of the society.\n* The **local sculptural tradition at Mathura** became so strong that the tradition spread to other parts of **northern India.**\n  + The best example in this regard is the **stupa sculptures** found at **Sanghol** in the **Punjab.**\n* Images of **Vaishnava** (mainly **Vishnu** and his various forms) and **Shaiva** (mainly the **lingas** and **mukhalingas**) faiths are also found at Mathura. It represents the religious belief of society.\n* The **Chola sculptures** started bronze casting sometime about the middle of the **tenth century A.D.** of the numerous bronze images, the **Nataraja image** in its various forms holds the first place.\n\nTypical life scenarios are shown in sculpture. Nearly all of the sculptures and paintings are motivated by the activities taking place in the immediate vicinity. All works of art, including sculptures, eventually aim to convey a message. Sculptures are created by artists to convey ideas, religious views, historical figures, and even heroic mythical tales.",

        "explanation": "Indians were recruited for the British East India Company's army because they were familiar with the conditions in India. Indians were prepared to take lower wages. As a result, the East India Company's overall expenditures were cheaper than those of contracted British army men. Because of the immense distance that separated Britain from India, the British people were not willing to move India. The English had enforced every available means of war and administrative procedures in order to consolidate their own authority over India.\n\n**Superior military and armaments strategy:**\n\n* The British had cannon and assault rifles that were more advanced in terms of their range and shooting speed than Indian weapons.\n* Many Indian rulers brought European weapons, but they were unable to develop war strategy like British authorities.\n\n**Armed regulation, dedication, and consistent remuneration:**\n\n* The British were very careful about a regular income and a rigid code of conduct that guaranteed the loyalty of the commanders and soldiers.\n* The rulers of India lacked the resources necessary to make regular salary payments.\n* Some of the kings were dependent on their own personal guards of unruly and disloyal mercenaries.\n\n**Effective leadership:**\n\n* Robert Clive, Warren Hastings, Elphinstone, Munro, and others demonstrated exceptional leadership traits.\n* The British also profited from second-line commanders like Sir Eyre Coote, Lord Lake, Arthur Wellesley, and others who stand up for their nation's interests and honor.\n* While the Indian side had excellent commanders like Haider Ali, Tipu Sultan, Madhu Rao, Sindhia, and Jaswant Rao Holkar, they needed a second line of leadership.\n\n**A solid financial foundation:**\n\n* A great deal of wealth was contributed to England by British trade, which led to government assistance in the form of money, materials, and other resources.\n\n**Absence of national pride and unification:**\n\n* Indian rulers lacked a cohesive political nationalism, which the British skillfully exploited to incite civil war among them.\n\nThe East India Company had a private army. The corporation utilized its armed power to impose terrible taxes, carry out officially approved plundering, subjugate Indian governments and principalities with which it had previously entered into commercial deals, and defend its economic exploitation of both skilled and unskilled Indian workers.",

        "explanation": "The term \"famine\" is derived from the Latin word \"Fames,\" which means \"hunger.\" Famine is defined as \"a state of intense hunger experienced by a region's population as a result of a lack of regular food supply.\"\n\n* The **1769-70** famine in **Bengal** followed two years of erratic rainfall but was worsened by a **smallpox epidemic.** The **1783-84** famine again followed a **crop failure** over a wide area.\n\n**Reasons**\n\n* **Drought:**\n  + The excessive rainfall in 1770 did not relieve the people from the sufferings of drought of the year before; on the contrary, it caused overflowing of rivers and damaged standing crops.\n  + The proximate cause of famines, without exception, was a sharp rise in food prices, which in turn reduced real wages and caused starvation, malnutrition and epidemic, mainly among agricultural laborer groups.\n* **Rural Indebtedness:**\n  + Debt has always been a major component of India's rural economy. Due to exorbitant rents and illegitimate taxation imposed by the British Government, peasants were heavily indebted, this indebtedness was exacerbated by the onset of severe drought-like circumstances which culminated in the onset of famines.\n* **British Policy:**\n  + The main cause of the devastating famines during the colonial rule was the British policy of exploitation, repression and oppression inflicted upon the Indian people.\n  + Mass export of agricultural produce to the England by the Britishers led to shortage of the food supply in India which ultimately culminated into the severe famine.\n  + Cornwallis introduced the permanent settlement in 1793. The peasants were dispossessed of their ownership of land by this strategy, which for the first time in India's agricultural history made the zamindars and talukdars the true landowners.\n\nFamines that occurred during the colonial era had a tremendous influence on the economy and even the culture. Famines unquestionably had a negative impact on population growth and slowed down economic development.",

        "explanation": "Igneous rocks are called primary rocks because they are the first one to be formed in the rock cycle and they do not leave any organic remains. They form when hot, molten rock crystallizes and solidifies.\n\nDepending upon where the molten rock solidifies, they can be divided into two types:\n\n* **Intrusive Igneous Rocks:** They form when magma is trapped deep inside the Earth where it cools very slowly over many thousands or millions of years until it solidifies. Slow cooling means the individual mineral grains have a very long time to grow, so they grow to a relatively large size. These rocks have a coarse-grained texture. Example - Diabase, Granite, Pegmatite and Peridotite.\n* **Extrusive Igneous Rocks:** They are produced when magma exits and cools above (or very near) the Earth's surface. These rocks form at erupting volcanoes, so molten rock erupts on the surface, the magma cools and solidifies almost instantly when it is exposed to the relatively cool temperature of the atmosphere. Quick cooling means that mineral crystals don't have much time to grow, so these rocks have a very fine-grained or even glassy texture. Hot gas bubbles are often trapped in the quenched lava, forming a bubbly, vesicular texture. Example - Basalt, Pumice, Obsidian and Andesite.",

It also suggests that the weather could change for the worse, causing disruption in day-to-day activities.\n* **Orange (Be prepared):** The orange alert is issued as a warning of extremely bad weather with the potential of disruption in commute with road and rail closures, and interruption of power supply.\n* **Red (Take Action):** When extremely bad weather conditions are certainly going to disrupt travel and power and have significant risk to life, the red alert is issued.\n\nIn Cyclone prone areas, the IMD issues cyclone warnings to state government officials in four stages:\n\n* **Pre-Cyclone Watch** - It is issued 72 hours prior and contains early warning about the development of a cyclonic disturbance in the north Indian Ocean.\n* **Cyclone Alert -** It is issued at least 48 hours prior to the expected commencement of adverse weather over the coastal areas.\n* **Cyclone Warning -** It is issued at least 24 hours in advance. Landfall point is forecast at this stage.\n* **Post Landfall Outlook -** it is issued at least 12 hours in advance of the expected time of landfall. It gives the likely direction of movement of the cyclone after its landfall.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Stage of Warning** | **Colour Code** |\n| Cyclone Alert | Yellow |\n| Cyclone Warning | Orange |\n| Post landfall out look | Red |",

However, these soils are deficient in nitrogen, phosphorus and organic matter.\n    - Cotton, pulses, millets, castor, tobacco, sugarcane, citrus fruits, linseed, etc. are mainly cultivated in black soil.\n  + **Rocks:**\n    - Ancient cave temples have been carved out of the Deccan basalts in many places and the Elephanta Caves located on a small island offshore Mumbai (Bombay) is one such place.\n* **Non-Ferrous Minerals:**\n  + **Bauxite:** India\u2019s reserves of bauxite are sufficient to keep the country self-reliant.\n    - Major reserves occur in Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhatisgarh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Goa and Uttar Pradesh.\n* **Ferrous Minerals:**\n  + India is endowed with fairly abundant resources of iron ore. It has the largest reserve of iron ore in Asia.\n    - The districts Maharashtra and Goa have also emerged as important producers of iron ore.\n* **Natural Gas:**\n  + It is obtained along with oil in all the oil fields, but exclusive reserves have been located along the eastern coast as well as Tripura, Rajasthan and offshore wells in Gujarat and Maharashtra.\n    - Recently, the National Geophysical Research Institute (NGRI) has noticed the presence of oil and natural gas in the Deccan region that spreads over a vast area including parts of Telangana, Karnataka, and Maharashtra.\n* **Geothermal Energy:**\n  + The western margin of volcanic Deccan traps, also known as Western Ghats, is characterized by the presence of numerous hot springs.\n* **Nuclear Energy:**\n  + Nuclear energy has emerged as a viable source in recent times. Important minerals used for the generation of nuclear energy are uranium and thorium.\n    - The important nuclear power projects are Tarapur (Maharashtra), Rawatbhata near Kota (Rajasthan), etc.",

        "explanation": "Early on in the company's rule, the East India Company began reorganising the territories in the states they captured, starting with Bengal, Bombay, and Madras Presidency. Since then, reorganisation and consolidation of states has been a constant process.\n\n#### **Phase-1 1850\u2019s to 1947:**\n\n* After the revolt of 1857, the British government accelerated the process of continuous political and administrative reorganisation.\n  + New presidencies were created (Central Province)\n  + Several independent states became part of the Chief Administration provinces (Assam, Awadh)\n* North-West Frontier Province, was created in 1901 from the north-western districts of the Punjab Province.\n* Bengal was partitioned in 1905 on the basis of religion and language.\n\n#### **Phase 2: 1947- 2022:**\n\n* In 1950, the Indian Constitution contained a four-fold classification of the states of the Indian Union- Part A, Part B, Part C and Part D States on a political and administrative basis.\n* In 1953, the States Reorganisation Commission (SRC) under Fazal Ali was constituted to recommend the reorganisation of state boundaries.\n  + Subsequently, the 7th Constitutional Amendment Act was passed which laid out two classifications of units:States and Union Territories.\n  + Andhra Pradesh became the first state to be formed on a linguistic basis.\n* Several territories acquired from the Portuguese (Goa, Daman, Diu, Dadra Nagar Haveli, and Puducherry) were incorporated into the Union Territories (Goa was given statehood later).\n* The creation of Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Uttarakhand was made possible by disintegrating regional boundaries and political territories from within the existing States of Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, respectively.\n* In 2014, Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act 2014 was passed that carved Telangana State out of Andhra Pradesh.\n  + The demand for separate statehood for Telangana has rested on factors such as the scale of inter-regional inequalities causing socio-economic backwardness of the region, inadequate industrial infrastructure, lack of educational and employment opportunities, diversion of water and natural resources of Telangana to the coastal region of Andhra, the hegemonic control of the coastal capitalist class over the Telangana region, etc.\n* Most recently, in 2019 the State of Jammu and Kashmir was reorganised for administrative and security purposes.\n\nAs our Indian Constitution is a living document, which allows reorganisation of states and union territories (Article-3), reorganisation of states may remain a continuous process with regard to the evolving nature of political and administrative dynamics.",

      "solution": {
        "explanation": "Ocean currents are like river flow in oceans. They represent a regular volume of water in a definite path and direction.\n\nOcean currents are influenced by two types of forces i.e. Primary Force, which initiates the movement of water while the secondary force influences the currents to flow. These forces are:\n\n* **Primary Force:**\n  + **Heating by Solar Energy**: It causes the water to expand which causes water to spread from hot to cold regions.\n  + **Wind:** Wind blowing on the ocean surface pushes the water to move on.\n  + **Gravity:** Gravity tends to pull the water down the pile and create gradient variation.\n  + **Coriolis Force:** It causes the water to move to the right in the northern hemisphere and to the left in the southern hemisphere.\n* **Secondary Force:**\n  + **Landmass**: Interaction of ocean with landmass results in change in direction of ocean current. For example: Brazil Ocean Current.\n  + **Salinity:** Water with high salinity is denser than water with low salinity, leading to variation in ocean currents as denser water tends to sink, while relatively lighter water tends to rise.\n\n**Ocean currents affect fishing industries in the following ways:**\n\n* **Creation of Fishing Zones:** Meeting of cold and warm ocean currents forms fishing zones in the ocean.\n  + Prominent examples are North East Pacific Zone, Newfoundland (Labradour & Gulf Stream), North West Pacific Zone along Japan (kuroshio and oyashio current) etc.\n  + Upwelling is a process in which currents bring deep, cold water to the surface of the ocean. Upwelling is a result of winds and the rotation of the Earth.\n* **Movement of Planktons:** Planktons are the organisms that come with ocean currents. They act as the base of the marine food chain and attract the fish populations towards them, leading to accumulation of fishes in a particular zone.\n  + Upwelling is a process in which currents bring deep, cold water to the surface of the ocean. The deeper water that rises to the surface during upwelling is rich in nutrients. These nutrients \u201cfertilize\u201d surface waters, encouraging the growth of plant life, including phytoplankton.\n* **Long Shelf Life:** Fishes in cold ocean currents have longer shelf life as compared to warm ocean currents, leading to non-perishable fish products.\n* **Ecological Balance:** Ocean currents maintain ecological balance by transferring water to the areas of less oceanic current and having low fish population to maintain oxygen level and fishes in the deficit area. Example: Saragasso Sea; Dead Zone.\n\nAlthough ocean current is the main player in creating fishing zones, the use of technology could be carried to develop fishing industries in other potential zones as well.",

        "explanation": "* Natural rubber is a polymer of isoprene, an organic compound. It comes from various sources, the most common being the Par\u00e1 rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis).\n* **Distribution of rubber producing countries:** Thailand produced 35% share of global natural rubber in 2020 followed by Indonesia.\n  + The tropical climate supports healthy rubber trees. It thrives in deep soil with resistance to flooding and in areas where the annual rainfall remains between 60 and 78 inches.\n* Despite **natural rubber being native to the Amazon basin**, approximately **90% of the world\u2019s supply is grown in Asia.** Much of this comes from Southeast Asia \u2013 specifically Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Malaysia.\n* The other countries of the world that are producing the rubbers are Ivory coast, Brazil, Mexico, Gabon, Guina, Ecuador and Sri Lanka etc.\n\n#### **Environmental issues:**\n\n* The rubber cultivation is a plantation crop and takes a long gestation period to become a fruitful crop for providing monetary benefits. This plantation incurs many negative externalities like:\n  + Countries like Malysia and Indonesia has lost a large part of its natural forest due to cultivation of Rubber.\n    - It also leads to extinction of biodiversity and population of some of the iconic species like orangutans have reduced.\n  + Preference to plantation crops like Rubber reduces the cultivation of the food crops and reduces the chance to achieve SDGs.\n  + Monotonous cropping pattern reduces the rejuvenation capacity of the soil and the accelerated application of the synthetic fertilizer further reduces the capacity of the soil and residue fertilizer prevails various illnesses in the society.\n  + The long gestation period of the rubber plantation (7-8 years) makes it more vulnerable to pests and other climate induced diseases and illnesses that hamper the interest of the small crop holders and bring the issue of livelihood.\n  + The rubber plantation itself is the source of various pollution and GHGs like:\n    - The open burning of rubber plantation wastes in the form of rubber tree stumps after land clearing (in Malaysia).\n    - Per kg dry rubber generates eight kg of effluents and its Natural degradation releases a huge amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane.\n    - The emission of the rubber industry has been linked to various diseases and diverse impacts on human health.\n  + The rubber industry is one of the major water polluting industries. It accelerates the problem of water scarcity in the rubber producing countries.\n\nIncreasing demand of rubber due to industrial expansion, the sustainable cultivation of rubber is the only way forward. The synthesis of local and global knowledge with the use of modern technology can prevail in the interest of all the stakeholders involved in the industry.",

E.g., Malacca strait, Gibraltar strait, etc.\n* An isthmus is a narrow strip of land that connects two larger landmasses and separates two bodies of water. E.g., Isthmus of Suez, connecting Africa and Asia.\n\n#### **Significance of Staits and Isthmus in international trade:**\n\n* They reduce distance between the places and facilitate greater trade. E.g., the Suez Canal on the isthmus of Suez prevents the circumvent of the Africa by ships for trade between Asia and Europe.\n* The straits and isthmus also provide good harbor and ports leading to international trade facilitation. E.g., Singapore port on the Malacca strait.\n* It also provides connectivity between lager landmass and the water bodies. Like Panam\u00e1 Canal on isthmus of Panama connects Atlantic and Pacific oceans.\n* It also revolutionizes the shipping industry by facilitating efficient transportation.\n* It provides the bridge between the demand and supply of the commodity. E.g., Japan buys the iron ore of India through the strait of Malacca.\n* It provides environmentally friendly shipping. E.g., By making the Palk Strait deeper, Indian ships could circumvent Sri Lanka (a long route) while transporting goods from Vizag to Kochin (saving fuel).\n* It facilitates the export and import of international trade in tourism services by providing recreational services along the coasts of the isthmus and straits.\n* It provides good ground for fishing and aquaculture and thus, promotes international trade in marine products.\n* It also provides the strategic place for defence establishment that facilitates international trade by providing security from pirates.",

        "explanation": "The troposphere is the first and lowest layer of the atmosphere of the Earth. Most of the mass (about 75-80%) of the atmosphere is in the troposphere, and is where most weather phenomena occur.\n\n* Weather refers to short-lived temperature, wind and precipitation conditions that vary from place to place.\n  + **Elements of Weather Processes:** Cloud cover, rain, snow, low or high temperatures, storms and wind.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Layers of Atmosphere** | **Height ( in km)** |\n| Exosphere | Beyond 400 |\n| Thermosphere | 80- 400 |\n| Mesosphere | 50- 80 |\n| Stratosphere | 10- 50 |\n| Troposphere | 0- 10 |\n\n#### **Significance of Troposphere in Determination of Weather Phenomena:**\n\n* Increasing altitude decreases temperature in the troposphere, thus keeping water from leaving this atmospheric layer.\n  + That\u2019s why the troposphere contains 99% of the total mass of water vapour and aerosols in the atmosphere, and it is therefore the source of most of the clouds that induce weather phenomena.\n* Ozone absorbs sunlight in the stratosphere to raise the air temperature. Thus, temperatures in the stratosphere generally rise with elevation (opposite in case of troposphere)\n  + The Stratosphere acts as a knot that inhibits vertical motion of winds, resulting in weather phenomena that can only be seen in the troposphere.\n* In the troposphere, water evaporates from the surface of the earth and is transported by the wind to other regions.\n  + The rise, expansion, and cooling of air causes water vapour to condense into clouds, producing an unstable atmosphere that causes rain.\n* Global winds and fronts occur in the troposphere creating weather events such as thunderstorms, hurricanes, tornadoes, and blizzards.\n\nTemperatures and weather patterns are shifting due to climate change, causing abnormal weather phenomena in the Troposphere like Heat Waves (recently in Europe and India). Therefore, there is a need to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impact (Sustainable Development Goal 13).",

Sects frequently form when society is undergoing rapid transformation.\n\nOwing to the rising socio-economic status of the sub-caste in India, they are asserting their dominance in political and socio sectors.

      },
      "solution": {
        "explanation": "In western nations, negative form of secularism is followed which means state is separate from religion and has nothing to do with religion of the people but in India, positive form of secularism is followed which means the state gives equal respect to all religions. Citizens can publicly wear their religious signs and symbols. There is no official religion of India.\n\nSecularism is an essential feature of Indian Constitution. This feature reflects the secular values of Indian society from ancient past. Tolerance, assimilation and pluralism are the key elements in the making of an Indian form of secularism.\n\n#### **Tolerance as the key element of Indian form of Secularism:**\n\nIt means people of different religions; sects have respect and tolerance for each other's religion.\n\n* India is where Buddhism and Jainism first appeared. These religions propagated a message of peace and tolerance.\n* The founder of the Sikh religion, Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji, preached about international brotherhood (tolerance).\n* Almost no native King forced his subjects to convert to another religion, with a few exceptions.\n* The religious tolerance policies of Mughal King Akbar and Buddhist King Ashoka are particularly well-known.\n* 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbaka' is a phrase in Maha Upanishad, a Hindu religious text which essentially means \"the world is family\".\n* The fundamental rights guaranteed by the state's constitution (Articles 25 to 28), which guarantee that everyone of its inhabitants has the right to practice any religion, represent the state's tolerance of all religions. The state doesn't have a recognized religion.\n\n#### **Assimilation as the key element of Indian form of Secularism:**\n\nAssimilation is the process whereby individuals or groups of differing ethnic heritage are absorbed into the dominant culture of a society.\n\n* People from all major religions coexist peacefully in India. India was the birthplace of Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism. Along with invaders from Persia and Afghanistan, Islam arrived in India. What's fascinating, though, is that new religions that developed here were introduced by invaders, yet they coexisted with the rest of society at the time without losing their distinctive identities.\n* When multiple religious communities coexist, over time they begin to incorporate elements of one another's art, architecture, culture, and religion. For instance, Mughal period produced a distinctive Mughal style as a result of the fusion of Persian Islamic architecture and native Indian design. The Mughal era strongly influenced the Rajput paintings of Jaipur and Amber.\n\n#### **Pluralism as the key element of Indian form of Secularism:**\n\nIt means people of different religion, sects, cultures live together with harmony.\n\n* Since ancient times, people of various sects and religions have lived in India. All of the world's main religions are represented in India. These include Islam, Hinduism, Christianity, Buddhism, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Sikhism, and Buddhism.\n* Each religion also has a number of subgroups. For instance, there are followers of Shaivism and Vaishnavism in Hinduism, and Sunni and Shia Muslims. Here, there are residents of various faiths and religions.\n* Around India, Buddhism first appeared in the sixth century BC. In India, Jainism grew mostly after the sixth century BC. After the 10th century AD, India was where Islam flourished most quickly. Sikhism was started by Guru Nanak Dev Ji in the 15th century. In the eighth century AD, Zoroastrianism arrived in India. Therefore, pluralism has always been a part of India.\n* With a few exceptions, the governing rulers did not meddle in peoples' religious practices. Instead, they offered them financial support and land for religious purposes. Secularism has therefore been a part of Indian society and culture for many years.",

      "solution": {
        "explanation": "* **Globalization** means growing interdependence and integration of world economies, societies and cultures brought about by cross border trade of goods, services and technology and flow of investment and people.\n* In the human world 'resource' is anything that can be used to fulfill our needs and wants. Often some resources are abundant in some nations and scarce in other nations. Mutual needs lead to cooperation between them.\n* The relations between globalization and new technology in the world of scarce resources have varied facets with its pros and cons.\n\n**The positives of the relation between globalization and new technology, in context of scarce resources are:**\n\n* **Natural Resources:** Globalization brings cooperation for efficient use of the resource. Like:\n  + Energy: India\u2019s global initiative i.e., International Solar Alliance (ISA) to tackle the scarcity of fossil fuel by securing solar energy.\n  + Infrastructure: Diven by technical knowledge and sustainable spirit, the organization like Coalition for Disaster Resilient infrastructure (CDRI) initiated by India for global contribution.\n* **Defence:** Indian engagement with global players and partners like Israel (Barak Missile), Philippines (Brahmos Missile), Russia (AK-203) to manage the security challenge.\n* **Space cooperation:** India\u2019s global cooperation with countries like Russia and France (Gaganyaan), US (NISAR Satellites) for best utilization of expensive resources.\n* **Transport and Communication:** Cooperation with global countries like Japan (Bullet train), EU (5G), etc.\n\n**Apart from the positive, there are negatives as well. Like:**\n\n* **Brain Drain:** Indian trained youth choose developed countries and devoid India for further development.\n* **Neo-tech-colonization** by the large tech giant on the name of data privacy, freedom of speech etc.\n* Diversion of scarce resources for technology adaptation (Bullet train) and thus **curtailing the expenditure on humanitarian development.**\n* Global relations promote the import of cutting-edge technologies. This decreases the forex on one hand and the technological research on the other hand. E.g., Not a single successful Indian handset in Indian market.\n* The monopoly and scarcity of strategic technologies compromised the security of Indians like Red Echo attack on Power supply in Mumbai by Chinese equipment.\n\nIn view of the advantages and disadvantages of India\u2019s relation with global world in an era of scarce resources, we have to be Atmanirbhar with suita ble and strategic global support to increase our capabilities.",
