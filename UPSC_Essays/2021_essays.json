      "The process of self-discovery has now been technologically outsourced.\n\nHave you ever scrolled through your social media feed, a kaleidoscope of curated lives flashing before your eyes, and felt a pang of… something?  Envy? Inadequacy? Or perhaps, a strange disconnect from your own, less-filtered reality? This, my friends, is the starting point of our discussion today.  The age-old quest for self-discovery, once a solitary journey inward, now seems increasingly outsourced to the gleaming algorithms and persuasive whispers of technology.  Like the ancient *rishis* who retreated to the forests for *atma-gyan* (self-knowledge), we now turn to our screens, hoping for digital enlightenment.  But are we truly finding ourselves, or are we losing ourselves further in the digital deluge?\n\nTechnology, undoubtedly, has democratised information. The whispers of ancient wisdom, once confined to dusty scriptures, are now accessible at our fingertips.  A curious mind can explore philosophies from Kashmir Shaivism to the *Bhakti* movement with a few clicks. Government initiatives like the Digital India programme have bridged the digital divide, bringing even remote villages into the fold.  But this access comes at a cost.  The sheer volume of information can be overwhelming, leading to a state of what I call \"information indigestion.\"  We consume, but we don't digest. We scroll, but we don't reflect.\n\nConsider the proliferation of personality tests online.  Are these digital oracles truly revealing hidden facets of our being, or are they simply reinforcing pre-existing biases, neatly packaged in colourful infographics?  The Myers-Briggs, the Enneagram, the Big Five – they categorise, they label, they offer a comforting sense of belonging.  But do they truly capture the fluidity, the *sahajata* (naturalness), of human personality?  As Swami Vivekananda said, \"Each soul is potentially divine.\"  Can an algorithm truly grasp the divine spark within each of us?\n\nMoreover, social media platforms, with their emphasis on external validation, have become the new battlegrounds for self-esteem.  The number of likes, the comments, the shares – they become the metrics by which we measure our worth. This constant comparison with others, this relentless pursuit of online approval, can lead to a distorted sense of self.  Young people, especially, are vulnerable to this digital pressure cooker.  I’ve seen it firsthand, teaching students from diverse backgrounds – from the bustling cities of Mumbai and Delhi to the quieter towns of Kerala and Odisha.  The anxiety, the insecurity, the fear of missing out – it’s a pervasive malaise.\n\nHowever, to paint technology as the villain in this narrative would be an oversimplification.  Like any tool, it can be used for good or ill.  Tele-medicine initiatives, for instance, have brought healthcare to remote corners of the country, fulfilling the Directive Principles of State Policy for ensuring the well-being of all citizens.  Similarly, online educational platforms are empowering learners, offering opportunities that were previously unimaginable.  The latest National Education Policy recognises the transformative potential of technology in education, aiming to create a more equitable and accessible learning ecosystem.\n\nThe key, I believe, lies in mindful engagement.  We must learn to use technology as a tool for self-discovery, not as a substitute for it.  We must cultivate the *viveka* (discernment) to distinguish between genuine insights and digital distractions. We must remember that true self-discovery is not a destination, but a journey, a *sadhana* (spiritual practice) that requires introspection, reflection, and a willingness to confront our own shadows.  Just as a farmer carefully tends to his field, weeding out unwanted plants, we must cultivate our inner landscape, nurturing the seeds of self-awareness.\n\nSo, the next time you find yourself scrolling endlessly through your phone, pause.  Take a deep breath.  Look up at the sky, at the trees, at the faces of the people around you.  Reconnect with the tangible world.  Remember that true self-discovery lies not in the digital echoes of others, but in the quiet whispers of your own heart.  It’s a journey worth taking, one imperfect step at a time. After all, isn’t that what life is all about – finding our own *swadharma* (own duty) in this vast, interconnected web of existence?\n"

    },
    "essay": [
      "The dusty lanes of my childhood in a small town near Madurai echo with the Tamil proverb, “Yaanaikkum adi sarukkum, aanaikkum adi sarukkum” – meaning, the elephant’s footprint can hold a puddle, as can the ant’s.  This simple saying encapsulates the essence of our topic: “Your perception of me is a reflection of you; my reaction to you is an awareness of me.” It speaks to the subjective nature of reality, how our individual experiences colour our judgements, and how our responses reveal our own inner landscape.  Isn’t it fascinating how we, like those elephants and ants, leave our unique imprints on the world?\n\nThe first part of this aphorism – \"Your perception of me is a reflection of you\" – reminds me of the story of the blind men and the elephant.  Each man, touching a different part of the animal, perceives it differently – a wall, a spear, a rope.  Their limited experience shapes their understanding, a potent reminder that our perceptions are often fragmented and incomplete, coloured by our own prejudices, biases, and \"samskaras\" (impressions).  Just as the Directive Principles of State Policy in our Constitution aim for a just and equitable society, our individual perceptions often fall short of encompassing the complete picture, leading to misunderstandings and conflict.\n\nThink about the recent debates around the new agricultural laws.  Farmers in Punjab saw it as a threat to their livelihoods, while policymakers in Delhi viewed it as a necessary reform.  Each perspective, valid in its own context, reflects the unique socio-economic realities of the stakeholders.  This isn't just a policy debate; it’s a human story, reflecting the anxieties and aspirations of different sections of our society.  The \"Atmanirbhar Bharat\" initiative, while aimed at boosting domestic production, has been perceived differently by various sectors, highlighting the subjective nature of progress itself.\n\nHowever, perception is not a static entity.  It's fluid, constantly evolving.  The \"Swachh Bharat Abhiyan,\" initially met with skepticism in some quarters, has gradually gained acceptance as its positive impact became evident.  This change underscores the importance of dialogue, education, and empathy in bridging the gap between perception and reality.  Just as the ancient texts of the Upanishads emphasize self-knowledge, understanding the filters through which we perceive the world is crucial for personal growth and societal harmony.\n\nNow, let's turn to the second part: \"My reaction to you is an awareness of me.\"  Here, the focus shifts from the external to the internal.  Our reactions, whether a flash of anger, a surge of empathy, or a quiet acceptance, are not just responses to external stimuli; they are windows into our own emotional and psychological state.  Gandhiji's philosophy of \"ahimsa\" (non-violence) wasn’t merely a political strategy; it was a reflection of his deep-seated belief in the inherent goodness of humanity.  Similarly, our responses, even in seemingly mundane interactions, reveal our values, our insecurities, and our aspirations.\n\nI remember an incident from my early teaching days in Delhi. A student challenged my interpretation of a historical event.  My initial reaction was defensive, but then I paused.  His question, though provocative, forced me to re-examine my own understanding.  It was a moment of \"aatma-chintan\" (self-reflection), a realisation that my reaction was rooted in my own need to be right.  This incident, though small, was a turning point in my journey as a teacher. It taught me the importance of humility and open-mindedness, qualities essential for navigating the complexities of human interaction.\n\nThe interplay between perception and reaction is a continuous dance.  It shapes our relationships, influences our decisions, and ultimately, defines our individual and collective destinies.  The \"Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas\" slogan, while aspirational, highlights the need for mutual understanding and respect in building a truly inclusive nation.  From the bustling metropolises of Mumbai and Bengaluru to the remote villages of the Northeast, our diverse nation thrives on the delicate balance between individual expression and collective responsibility.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Your perception of me is a reflection of you; my reaction to you is an awareness of me\" is not just a philosophical statement; it’s a practical guide for navigating the complexities of human interaction.  It’s a call for empathy, for self-awareness, and for a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of all beings.  Just as the rivers of India, from the Ganga to the Brahmaputra, flow towards the ocean, our individual journeys, shaped by our perceptions and reactions, ultimately contribute to the larger narrative of human experience.  It is in this confluence of perspectives that we find the true meaning of \"Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam\" - the world is one family.\n"

      "## Between Wantlessness and Materialism: Navigating the Indian Labyrinth\n\nA wizened old woman in a remote Himalayan village, content with her simple meal of roti and lentil soup, embodies an ideal – the philosophy of wantlessness.  Across the bustling metropolis of Mumbai, a young entrepreneur chases the next big deal, fuelled by the allure of material possessions.  These contrasting images encapsulate the enduring tension between two powerful forces shaping human existence: the pursuit of material wealth and the yearning for inner peace.  Is the philosophy of wantlessness, as some argue, a utopian dream, forever beyond our grasp?  And is materialism, with its promise of happiness, merely a chimera, a shimmering illusion?  Perhaps the truth, as is often the case, lies somewhere in the delicate balance between these two extremes, a balance uniquely informed by the Indian ethos.\n\nThe allure of materialism is undeniable.  We are, after all, creatures of needs and desires.  From the basic necessities of food, clothing, and shelter to the more aspirational desires for education, healthcare, and social mobility, material possessions play a crucial role in our lives.  Government schemes like the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, aimed at providing affordable housing, acknowledge this reality.  However, the relentless pursuit of material wealth, divorced from ethical considerations, can quickly morph into a dangerous obsession.  The ancient Indian scriptures warn against this very trap.  The Bhagavad Gita, for instance, cautions against “lobha,” or greed, highlighting its destructive potential.  Like the mythical \"maya,\" materialism can blind us to the true nature of reality, leading us down a path of dissatisfaction and suffering.  I recall a conversation with a successful businessman in Bengaluru who, despite his immense wealth, confessed to a deep sense of emptiness.  His words resonated with the age-old wisdom of the Upanishads, which emphasize the importance of inner peace over external possessions.\n\nYet, to dismiss the philosophy of wantlessness as utopian is to ignore its profound influence on Indian thought and culture.  From the ascetic traditions of Jainism and Buddhism to the concept of “aparigraha” (non-possessiveness) in yoga philosophy, the idea of limiting one’s desires has been a recurring theme in our civilization. Mahatma Gandhi’s simple lifestyle, a powerful symbol of his philosophy of self-sufficiency and resistance to colonial rule, serves as a potent reminder of the transformative power of wantlessness.  This resonates with the Directive Principles of State Policy, which advocate for a just and equitable society where basic needs are met for all. However, in a country grappling with widespread poverty and inequality, the ideal of complete wantlessness can seem like a distant dream.  The socio-economic realities of rural India, where millions struggle for basic survival, underscore the need for a pragmatic approach that balances spiritual aspirations with material necessities.\n\nThe key, perhaps, lies in finding a middle path, a “madhyam marg,” as Buddha would say.  This involves recognizing the legitimate role of material possessions in improving our lives while simultaneously cultivating a sense of detachment from them.  The concept of “trusteeship,” advocated by Gandhiji, offers a valuable framework.  It encourages us to view our wealth not as personal property but as a resource held in trust for the benefit of society.  This resonates with the spirit of the Five-Year Plans, which aim to promote inclusive growth and development.  Moreover, it aligns with the constitutional values of social justice and equality.\n\nFurthermore,  the unique socio-cultural fabric of India, with its diverse traditions and belief systems, offers a rich tapestry of perspectives on this complex issue.  The \"jugaad\" mentality, a quintessential Indian characteristic, exemplifies our ability to find innovative solutions with limited resources. This ingenuity, born out of necessity, can be a powerful tool in bridging the gap between wantlessness and materialism.  For instance, the self-help groups (SHGs) flourishing in states like Kerala and Andhra Pradesh demonstrate how collective action and resource sharing can empower marginalized communities and promote economic self-reliance.\n\nIn conclusion, while the pursuit of absolute wantlessness might remain a utopian ideal and unchecked materialism a deceptive chimera, navigating the space between these two extremes is a continuous journey, a \"sadhana,\" if you will.  It requires us to cultivate a mindset that values both material progress and spiritual growth, a mindset that is deeply rooted in the Indian ethos of \"Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam\" – the world is one family.  By embracing this holistic perspective, we can strive towards a future where both individual well-being and collective prosperity are realized, not as mutually exclusive goals, but as interconnected facets of a harmonious existence.\n"

    "essay": [
      "The real is rational and the rational is real.  Hegel’s profound assertion, echoing through the corridors of philosophy, resonates deeply with the Indian ethos, a land where the abstract and the concrete have always danced in a delicate embrace.  My grandmother, a simple woman from a village in Haryana, used to say, \"Jo dikhta hai, woh bikta hai\" (What is seen, is sold).  A seemingly simple observation, yet it encapsulates the essence of Hegel’s dialectic – the interplay between the tangible reality and the power of reason to comprehend and shape it.\n\nThis interplay, however, is not always harmonious.  The “real” – the lived experiences of millions – often clashes with the “rational” – the grand narratives of progress and development.  Take, for instance, the farmer in Maharashtra, burdened by debt and struggling with erratic monsoons. His reality is starkly different from the rational projections of agricultural growth presented in the latest Five-Year Plan. This dissonance raises fundamental questions: Whose rationality are we talking about?  Is it the rationality of the policymaker, sitting in an air-conditioned office in Delhi, or the rationality of the farmer, toiling under the scorching sun?\n\nThe Directive Principles of State Policy, enshrined in our Constitution, articulate a vision of a just and equitable society.  They represent the \"rational\" aspirations of our founding fathers – a society free from poverty, inequality, and exploitation. Yet, the \"real\" continues to be plagued by these very challenges.  The widening gap between the rich and the poor, the persistence of caste discrimination, and the environmental degradation we witness across the country – from the polluted Yamuna in Delhi to the depleting forests of the Western Ghats – all point to a disconnect between the rational ideals and the lived realities.\n\nHowever, to suggest that the ideal and the real are irreconcilable would be a grave error.  The \"real\" is not static; it is constantly evolving, shaped by the forces of reason and human agency.  The Mahatma's philosophy of Satyagraha, a powerful blend of the real and the rational, exemplifies this.  He used the \"real\" suffering of the Indian people under colonial rule to fuel a \"rational\" movement for freedom, appealing to the conscience of the oppressor.  His success demonstrated the transformative power of aligning the real with the rational.\n\nSimilarly, the recent success of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan showcases how a rationally designed programme, rooted in the \"real\" needs of the people, can bring about significant change.  While challenges remain, the programme has undoubtedly raised awareness about sanitation and hygiene, leading to tangible improvements in many parts of the country, especially in rural areas like the villages of Sikkim I visited last year.  This initiative demonstrates how the government can leverage \"rational\" policy interventions to address the \"real\" concerns of the people.\n\nFurthermore, the \"rational\" pursuit of economic growth must be tempered with a deep understanding of the \"real\" social and environmental costs. The “Aatmanirbhar Bharat” initiative, while aiming to boost domestic production and create jobs, must also consider its impact on vulnerable sections of society.  We need to ensure that the fruits of development reach everyone, not just a privileged few. As Thiruvalluvar, the great Tamil philosopher, said, \"Even if it is only a little, give it to those who need it most.\"  This reflects the Indian ethos of compassion and inclusivity, a crucial element in bridging the gap between the rational and the real.\n\nThe challenge, therefore, lies not in choosing between the real and the rational, but in finding ways to integrate them. This requires a multi-pronged approach – strengthening democratic institutions, promoting participatory governance, empowering marginalized communities, and fostering a culture of dialogue and debate. It also necessitates a shift in our mindset, from a narrow focus on economic growth to a more holistic approach that prioritizes social justice, environmental sustainability, and human well-being.  Perhaps, the ancient Indian concept of \"Lokasamgraha,\" the welfare of all beings, offers a valuable framework for navigating this complex terrain.\n\nIn conclusion, while there may be seeming contradictions between the \"real\" and the \"rational,\" they are ultimately two sides of the same coin.  The real informs the rational, and the rational shapes the real.  By embracing this dynamic interplay, by striving to align our aspirations with our actions, we can create a future where the real is truly rational, and the rational is truly real – a future worthy of the dreams of our forefathers and the hopes of generations to come.  It is a journey, not a destination, and one that requires constant vigilance, introspection, and a commitment to the values that define us as a nation.  After all, as the saying goes, \"Yatra naryastu pujyante, ramante tatra Devata\" (Where women are honored, divinity blossoms there).  This speaks to the heart of our civilizational ethos, an ethos that seeks to harmonize the material and the spiritual, the real and the rational, in the pursuit of a more just and equitable world.\n"

    },
    "essay": [
      "\"A child’s first teacher is its mother.\"  This simple yet profound adage, echoing across generations, encapsulates the very essence of the saying, \"The hand that rocks the cradle rules the world.\"  While seemingly assigning a limited domestic sphere to women, the phrase, when unpacked, speaks volumes about the immense power of nurturing and the long-term impact of early childhood experiences on shaping individuals, and consequently, nations.  Is this power then limited to biological mothers? Certainly not. The \"hand\" symbolizes anyone who plays a crucial role in shaping young minds – parents, grandparents, teachers, and even society at large.  This essay will explore the multifaceted implications of this timeless wisdom, examining its relevance in contemporary India and the crucial role it plays in shaping our collective future.\n\nFrom the Vedic times, where the concept of *matru devo bhava* (mother is God) was deeply ingrained, to the present day, where we acknowledge the crucial role of *anganwadis* (rural childcare centres) in early childhood development, India has always recognized the importance of nurturing.  Think of Rani Lakshmibai, whose courage and patriotism continue to inspire generations.  Could her unwavering spirit not be traced back to the values instilled in her during her formative years?  Similarly, the quiet dignity and resilience of the women farmers of Maharashtra's drought-prone regions – are they not the bedrock of their families and communities, truly ruling their world despite adversity?\n\nThe National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, with its emphasis on foundational literacy and numeracy, underscores the significance of early childhood education.  By recognizing the first five years as crucial for cognitive development, the policy echoes the wisdom of our ancient texts, which emphasized the importance of *sanskaras* (values) imparted during early childhood.  However, the implementation of such policies faces challenges, particularly in rural areas, where access to quality early childhood care remains limited.  The Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) programme, while a step in the right direction, needs further strengthening to truly reach every child.\n\nBut is this solely a woman's responsibility? The patriarchal mindset, still prevalent in many parts of India, often relegates childcare solely to women, hindering their own personal and professional growth.  This isn't just unfair; it's detrimental to the nation's progress.  The true potential of \"the hand that rocks the cradle\" can only be realized when both parents, and indeed society as a whole, share the responsibility of nurturing.  Remember the inspiring story of Arunachalam Muruganantham, the \"Pad Man\" of India.  His dedication to improving women's hygiene stemmed from his deep empathy and care, demonstrating that men too can play a pivotal role in nurturing and empowering.\n\nFurthermore, the digital age presents both opportunities and challenges. While online educational resources can supplement traditional learning, excessive screen time can negatively impact a child's development.  This calls for a judicious approach, balancing traditional wisdom with modern technology.  Just like the *Gurukul* system of ancient India emphasized holistic development, we must strive to create an environment that fosters creativity, critical thinking, and emotional intelligence in our children.  Perhaps, we can learn from the North-Eastern states, where community involvement in education is deeply ingrained, resulting in higher literacy rates.\n\nIn conclusion, the hand that rocks the cradle does indeed rule the world. It shapes not just individuals but the destiny of nations.  This power, however, is not limited by gender or biology. It is a shared responsibility, a collective endeavour that demands our attention and commitment.  By investing in early childhood care, promoting gender equality, and fostering a nurturing environment, we can empower future generations to build a stronger, more equitable, and vibrant India.  As Swami Vivekananda rightly said, \"Education is the manifestation of perfection already in man.\" It is this nurturing, this shaping of young minds, that unlocks the potential within, allowing individuals, and indeed the nation, to reach their full potential. And isn’t that what truly “ruling the world” should mean – not dominance, but enabling, empowering, and nurturing the future?\n"

    "essay": [
      "What is research, but a blind date with knowledge!\n\nImagine stepping into a dimly lit café, heart aflutter with a mixture of anticipation and trepidation. You’re about to meet someone you’ve only heard whispers about – their profile intriguing, their potential captivating.  This, my friends, is not a description of a Saturday night rendezvous, but a surprisingly apt analogy for the thrilling, and sometimes frustrating, world of research.  Just as a blind date promises the unknown, research is a leap of faith into the vast expanse of knowledge, a journey where the destination is often unclear, but the process itself is transformative.\n\nResearch, in its purest form, is a quest for truth.  It is the relentless pursuit of answers, the burning curiosity that propels us beyond the comfortable confines of the known.  Like the ancient rishis who meditated under banyan trees, seeking enlightenment, researchers today pore over data, conduct experiments, and engage in deep contemplation to unravel the mysteries of the universe.  This pursuit, as the Upanishads teach us, is a form of ‘Atma-jnana’, or self-knowledge, as every discovery expands not only our understanding of the world but also our own intellectual horizons.  \n\nThe Indian Constitution, in its wisdom, enshrines the pursuit of knowledge as a fundamental right.  Our Directive Principles of State Policy further emphasise the importance of scientific temper and research for national development.  From the Green Revolution, which transformed India from a food-deficient nation to a global agricultural powerhouse, to the Chandrayaan missions, which propelled India into the elite club of spacefaring nations, research has been the bedrock of our progress.  However, access to quality research opportunities remains unevenly distributed.  While premier institutions like the IITs and IISc are globally recognised, many universities, particularly in rural areas, lack adequate infrastructure and funding.  Bridging this gap is crucial for realizing the full potential of our demographic dividend.\n\nBut research is not without its challenges. Like a blind date gone awry, it can be frustrating, time-consuming, and sometimes even heartbreaking.  Experiments fail, hypotheses are disproven, and the path forward can seem shrouded in darkness.  The 'jugaad' mentality, while resourceful in certain contexts, cannot substitute for rigorous scientific methodology.  We need to cultivate a culture of patience and perseverance, recognizing that setbacks are an inevitable part of the research process.  As Swami Vivekananda said, \"Arise, awake, and stop not till the goal is reached.\"\n\nMoreover, research must be ethically grounded. The allure of quick results or personal gain should never compromise the integrity of the scientific process. The recent controversies surrounding plagiarism and data fabrication highlight the need for stricter ethical guidelines and robust oversight mechanisms.  Just as ‘Dharma’ guides our actions in life, ethical considerations must underpin all research endeavors.\n\nFurthermore, research should not remain confined to the ivory towers of academia.  It needs to be translated into tangible solutions that address the pressing challenges facing our nation.  The government's 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' initiative, which emphasizes self-reliance in various sectors, provides a fertile ground for research and innovation.  From developing drought-resistant crops for farmers in Maharashtra to creating sustainable energy solutions for remote villages in Arunachal Pradesh, research can empower communities and drive inclusive growth.  \n\nThe National Education Policy 2020, with its focus on interdisciplinary research and holistic learning, is a step in the right direction.  It recognizes that research is not merely about accumulating knowledge, but about applying it creatively to solve real-world problems.  This echoes the ancient Indian tradition of ‘Gurukul’ education, where learning was integrated with practical application and community service.\n\nIn conclusion, research is indeed a blind date with knowledge – a journey of discovery filled with both excitement and uncertainty.  By embracing the spirit of inquiry, fostering ethical practices, and connecting research with societal needs, we can unlock the transformative power of knowledge and build a brighter future for India.  As the saying goes, \"ज्ञानं परमं ध्येयम्\" – Knowledge is the ultimate goal. Let us strive to achieve it, not for personal glory, but for the betterment of humanity.\n"

      "language": "en"
    },
    "essay": [
      "History Repeats Itself: Tragedy to Farce, India's Evolving Narrative\n\n“Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it,” George Santayana famously warned.  But what if, as Karl Marx quipped, the repetition takes a twisted turn – first as tragedy, then as farce? This essay will explore this potent idea within the kaleidoscope of Indian history, examining how past patterns, both tragic and farcical, continue to shape our present and future.\n\nIndia, a land steeped in ancient wisdom, has witnessed cycles of glory and decline, of invasion and resilience. The tragic partition of 1947, a wound that continues to bleed into our collective consciousness, stands as a stark example.  Millions displaced, countless lives lost – a tragedy born from the seeds of communal hatred.  Didn't the ancient scriptures warn us against such “Vibheda” (division)?  Yet, we stumbled, blinded by the ephemeral allure of divisive politics.\n\nNow, decades later, do we see echoes of this tragedy, albeit in a different form?  The rise of divisive narratives, the manipulation of social media, the erosion of trust – these are not tragedies in the same scale, but they carry a farcical element. We seem to be re-enacting the past, not with the same intensity, but with a disturbingly familiar rhythm.  It’s like a badly produced remake of a classic play – the actors are different, the costumes gaudy, the dialogues clumsy, yet the plot remains eerily similar.  Haven't we learnt our lesson?  “Ati sarvatra varjayet” (Excess in anything is bad), as our ancestors wisely advised.\n\nConsider the economic sphere. The licence raj, a well-intentioned policy aimed at promoting self-reliance, descended into a bureaucratic labyrinth, stifling innovation and entrepreneurship. A tragedy for a nation aspiring to economic greatness.  Now, while we have embraced liberalisation, do we not see shades of this past in the form of crony capitalism and regulatory hurdles?  Perhaps a farce, less devastating, yet a reminder of our tendency to swing between extremes.  The \"Atmanirbhar Bharat\" (Self-reliant India) initiative, while laudable, must learn from the ghosts of policies past.  We need a balanced approach, blending the swadeshi spirit with the dynamism of global markets.\n\nLook at our environmental policies. The Green Revolution, initially hailed as a miracle, eventually led to soil degradation and water depletion in regions like Punjab and Haryana.  A tragic oversight in our pursuit of food security.  Now, as we champion sustainable agriculture and promote organic farming, are we not witnessing a farcical repetition of sorts?  The lack of adequate market linkages, the slow adoption of technology, the challenges in reaching small and marginal farmers – these are not tragedies of the same magnitude, but they represent a failure to learn from the past.\n\nHowever, the narrative isn't all doom and gloom.  India has also demonstrated an extraordinary capacity to learn and adapt.  The success of our democratic institutions, the strides we have made in poverty reduction, the emergence of a vibrant civil society – these are testaments to our resilience. The recent focus on digital inclusion through initiatives like \"Digital India\" reflects a proactive approach to leveraging technology for societal good, a far cry from the technological inertia of the past.\n\nFurthermore, the spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship, particularly among our youth, offers a glimmer of hope.  From the bustling startups of Bengaluru to the grassroots innovations in rural Maharashtra, we see a new India taking shape, one that is less burdened by the baggage of the past.  The National Education Policy 2020, with its emphasis on skill development and holistic learning, aims to equip our youth for the challenges of the 21st century.\n\nThe path forward lies in embracing the wisdom of our past while charting a new course for the future.  We must remember the tragedies, acknowledge the farces, and strive to create a narrative that is both uniquely Indian and universally relevant.  As Swami Vivekananda exhorted, “Arise, awake, and stop not till the goal is reached.”  This is our \"dharma\" (duty), our responsibility to future generations.  Let us not repeat history, but create a new one, a history of progress, inclusivity, and sustainable development, a history that truly reflects the spirit of “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam” (The world is one family).\n"

      "There are Better Practices to ‘Best Practices’\n\nThe shimmering allure of \"best practices\" often blinds us to a fundamental truth: what works brilliantly in one context might falter in another.  Like a brightly coloured kite soaring high, seemingly effortless, we often forget the intricate network of strings and the constant adjustments needed to keep it aloft.  Simply replicating a “best practice” without considering the unique socio-cultural winds and the specific terrain below can lead to a spectacular crash.  Isn't it ironic then, that in our pursuit of excellence, we sometimes become prisoners of pre-defined formulas?\n\nThe very term “best practice” suggests a finality, a pinnacle achieved.  But as the ancient scriptures remind us, \"Charaiveti, Charaiveti,\" – keep moving, keep evolving.  The dynamism inherent in our world, particularly in a nation as diverse as India, necessitates a constant re-evaluation of what constitutes “best.”  Take, for instance, the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. While the programme has undeniably catalysed a sanitation revolution in many urban areas, its implementation in rural India, with varying levels of infrastructure and social capital, has required significant adaptation.  The “best practice” of door-to-door garbage collection, effective in Mumbai, might not be feasible in the remote villages of Arunachal Pradesh.  Perhaps, decentralised composting methods, leveraging traditional knowledge, prove more suitable. This highlights the need for context-specific solutions, not a blind adherence to pre-determined models.\n\nFurthermore, the pursuit of “best practices” can sometimes stifle innovation.  Why strive for “better” when “best” has already been declared?  This can create a culture of complacency, hindering the exploration of potentially more effective approaches.  Remember the midday meal scheme?  Initially conceived as a way to improve school attendance, it has evolved over time to address issues of nutrition, women's empowerment (through involvement in cooking), and even social cohesion.  This evolution was possible because policymakers remained open to experimentation and adaptation, going beyond the initial “best practice” framework.\n\nThe Directive Principles of State Policy, enshrined in our Constitution, call for a just and equitable society.  Blindly adopting “best practices” without considering their impact on different sections of society can exacerbate existing inequalities. For example, the digitalisation drive, while undoubtedly a step towards a more efficient governance system, can exclude those lacking digital literacy, particularly in rural areas and amongst the elderly.  Thus, a \"best practice\" for some can become a barrier for others.  This reminds me of a conversation I had with a farmer in Maharashtra who, despite owning a smartphone, struggled to access government subsidies due to complicated online procedures.  His experience underscores the need for \"inclusive best practices,\" those that bridge the digital divide and ensure equitable access to benefits.\n\nHowever, discarding the concept of \"best practices\" altogether would be throwing the baby out with the bathwater.  They serve as valuable benchmarks, providing a starting point for innovation and adaptation.  The success of the National Health Mission in reducing infant mortality, for instance, can be attributed in part to the adoption of “best practices” from other countries, adapted to the Indian context.  The key lies in recognising their limitations and embracing a spirit of continuous improvement – “Kaizen,” as the Japanese call it.\n\nSo, what constitutes a better approach to “best practices”?  Perhaps, a shift in mindset is needed. Instead of seeking a static “best,” we should strive for “better,” fostering a culture of continuous learning, adaptation, and innovation.  This involves embracing local knowledge, empowering communities, and fostering participatory approaches to development.  It requires us to move beyond the seductive simplicity of pre-packaged solutions and engage in the messy, complex, but ultimately more rewarding process of creating context-specific, inclusive, and sustainable solutions.  This, I believe, is the true essence of “Atmanirbhar Bharat,” a self-reliant India built not on borrowed “best practices,” but on the strength of its own diverse and dynamic knowledge systems.  After all, isn't the real “best practice” the one that empowers us to constantly strive for better?\n"
