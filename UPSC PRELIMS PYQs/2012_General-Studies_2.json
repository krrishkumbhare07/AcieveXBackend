      "question_para": "PASSAGE-2     Chemical pesticides lose their role in sustainable agriculture if the pests evolve resistance. The evolution of pesticide resistance is simply natural selection in action. It is almost  certain to occur when vast numbers of a genetically variable  population are killed. One or a few individuals may be unusually resistant (perhaps because they possess an enzyme that can detoxify  the pesticide). If the pesticide is applied repeatedly, each  successive generation of the pest will contain a larger proportion of  resistant individuals. Pests typically have a high intrinsic rate of reproduction, and so a few individuals in one generation may give rise to hundreds or thousands in the next, and resistance spreads very rapidly in a population.      This problem was often ignored in the past, even though the first case of DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane)  resistance was reported early as 1946. There is exponential increase in  the numbers of invertebrates that have evolved resistance and in  the number of pesticides against which resistance has evolved. Resistance has been recorded in every family of arthropod  pests (including dipterans such as mosquitoes and house flies, as  well as beetles, moths, wasps, fleas, lice and mites) as well as in  weeds and plant pathogens. Take the Alabama leaf-worm, a moth  pest of cotton, as an example. It has developed resistance in one or  more   regions of the world to aldrin, DDT, dieldrin, endrin, lindane and toxaphene.    If chemical pesticides brought nothing but, problems, — if their use was intrinsically and acutely unsustainable — then  they would already have fallen out of widespread use. This has not happened. Instead, their rate of production has increased  rapidly.  The ratio of cost to benefit for the individual agricultural  producer has remained in favour of pesticide use. In the USA,  insecticides have been estimated to benefit the agricultural products to  the tune of around  $5 for every $1 spent.     Moreover, in many poorer countries, the prospect of imminent mass starvation, or of an epidemic disease, are so frightening that the social and health costs of using pesticides have to be ignored. In general the use of pesticides is justified   by objective measures such as ‘lives saved’, ‘economic efficiency of food production’ and ‘total food produced’. In these very fundamental senses, their use may be described as  sustainable.    In practice, sustainability depends on continually developing  new pesticides that keep at least one step ahead of the pests – pesticides that are less persistent, biodegradable and more accurately targeted all the pests.",

Adaptation and mitigation need to be integrated into a  climate-smart development strategy that increases resilience,  reduces the threat of further global warming, and improves development outcomes. Adaptation and mitigation measures can advance development, and prosperity can raise incomes and foster  better institutions.

Advancing robust, resilient development policies that promote adaptation is needed today because changes in the climate, already begun, will increase even in the short term.     The spread of economic prosperity has always been intertwined with adaptation to changing ecological conditions.

As economic historians have explained, much of humankind's creative potential has been directed at adapting  to the changing world.

Your answers to these items should be based on the passages only.       PASSAGE-1    Invasions of exotic species into new geographic areas  sometimes occur naturally and without human agency.   However, human actions have increased this trickle to a flood. Human- caused introductions may occur either accidentally as a consequence of human transport, or intentionally but illegally  to serve some private purpose or legitimately to procure some  hoped for public benefit by bringing a pest under control,  producing  new agricultural products or providing novel recreational opportunities. Many introduced species are assimilated into communities without much obvious effect. However, some  have been responsible for dramatic changes to native species and natural communities. For example, the accidental introduction  of the brown tree snake Boiga irregularis into Guam, an island in the Pacific, has through nest predation reduced 10 endemic  forest bird species to the point of extinction.    One of the major reasons for the world's great biodiversity is the occurrence of centers of endemism so that similar  habitats in different parts of the world are occupied by different  groups of species that happen to have evolved there. If every species naturally had access to everywhere on the globe, we might  expect a relatively small number of successful species to become  dominant in each biome. The extent to which this homogenization can happen naturally is restricted by the limited powers of  dispersal of most species in the face of the physical barriers that exist  to dispersal. By virtue of the transport opportunities offered  by humans, these barriers have been breached by an ever- increasing number of exotic species. The effects of introductions have  been to convert a hugely diverse range of local community compositions into something much more homogeneous.   It would be wrong, however, to conclude that introducing species to a region will inevitably cause a decline in species richness there. For example, there are numerous species of  plants,  invertebrates and vertebrates found in continental Europe  but  absent from the British Isles (many because they have so  far  failed to recolonize after the last glaciations). Their  introduction would be likely to augment British biodiversity. The   significant detrimental effect noted above arises where aggressive  species provide a novel challenge to endemic biotas ill-equipped to  deal with them",

Development can scarcely be seen merely in terms of enhancement of  inanimate objects of convenience, such as a rise in the GNP (or in personal incomes), or industrialization – important as they may be as means to the real ends. Their value must depend on what they do to the lives and freedom of the people involved, which must be central to the idea of development.   If development is understood in a broader way, with a focus on human lives, then it becomes immediately clear that the  relation between development and democracy has to be seen partly  in terms of their constitutive connection, rather than only through their external links. Even though the question has often been asked whether political freedom is ‘‘conducive to development’’, we must not miss the crucial recognition that political liberties and democratic rights are among the “constituent components” of development.

      "question_para": "PASSAGE-2   Most champions of democracy have been rather reticent in suggesting that democracy would itself promote development and enhancement of social welfare–they have tended to see  them as good but distinctly separate and largely independent goals. The detractors of democracy, on the other hand, seemed to  have been quite willing to express their diagnosis of what they see  as serious tensions between democracy and development. The theorists of the practical split — ‘‘Make up your mind : do you want democracy, or instead, do you want development ?’’ — often came, at least to start with, from East Asian countries,  and their voice grew in influence as several of these countries were immensely successful – through the 1970s and 1980s and  even later – in promoting economic growth without pursuing democracy.    To deal with these issues we have to pay particular attention to both the content of what can be called development and to  the interpretation of democracy (in particular to the respective  roles of voting and of public reasoning).
