        "explanation": "Judiciary, legislature and executive are the pillars of a democratic nation, sharing powers amongst themselves. In this, a judiciary free from the orders and whims of executive and legislature is of utmost importance for retaining and practising values of the constitution.\n\n### Why judicial independence?\n\n* Separation between executive and judiciary must be maintained to relieve the courts of any political biasness that might hamper justice for anyone.\n* A court\u2019s verdict must be based solely on facts and not the perceived reality or partiality of the judge ensuring impartial judgement.\n\n### Why constitutionally backed judicial independence is important?\n\n* The judicial system works under the constitution. It is righty referred to as the guardian of the constitution, having the power as the final authority on its interpretation.\n* Unless the independence of the judiciary is constitutionally backed, it can be easily curtailed by the legislature or an executive order.\n\n**Provisions under the constitution**\n\n* Non-interference of legislature in the appointment of judges.\n* Fixed tenure of the judges.\n* Due process of impeachment for removal of a sitting judge.\n* Parliament cannot discuss the conduct of judges.\n* Charging of the salaries and allowances on the Consolidated Fund of India, thereby no need for legislative approval.\n\nThrough various provisions of the Constitution, India retains an unrestricted yet discipled judiciary that is relied on by the entire country with reverence.",

Despite constitutional provisions provided by the 74th Amendment Act, 1992, these bodies continue to face problem primarily of funds and functionaries.\n\n### How states are reluctant?\n\n* **Lack of Finance:** ULBs rely on state governments for grants, as their sources of income are inadequate, and taxes collected are not sufficient.\n  + While ULBs are allowed to collect taxes, they tend to avoid it to not displease the electorate.\n  + Instruments to raise capital such as municipal bonds, public-private partnerships and monetization of existing infrastructure are all arenas of raising capital that are currently untapped.\n* **Functional Control:** Despite there being a constitutional mandate under Articles 243P to 243ZG, state governments show reluctancy in devolving powers to the ULBs.\n  + **Parallel Structures:** Bodies like water boards, and development authorities take away the responsibilities and powers from the ULBs.\n  + **Bureaucratic Overpower:** Decision making power of the elected representatives is heavily curtailed by the state appointed bureaucracy.\n\nHence, there is a long way to go for liberalization of Urban Local Bodies and proper devolution of powers, so that they can realize their full potential.",

        "explanation": "**British vs Indian parliament**\n\n* While Britain follows the concept of parliamentary supremacy, with its legislative body exercising absolute sovereignty over the nation, India follows a system of constitutional sovereignty with the Constitution being over and above, even the Parliament.\n* Upon passing of a bill by the UK\u2019s parliament, the monarch\u2019s approval is taken only as a formality. While in the case of India, the President has powers to return a bill for reconsideration or withhold assent.\n* UK allows the PM to be elected only from the House of Commons, thereby ensuring a proper representation of the people's choice. Whereas in India, the PM can be selected from either house which, in the case of the Rajya Sabha, would not mean a true representation of the country's electoral choice.\n* A lack in parliamentary sovereignty is evident in the existence of a separate parliament of Scotland within the UK. As opposed to this, in India, even when the special status of Jammu & Kashmir was present, there is a single Parliament.\n\nWhile India is often believed to have a system congruent to the Westminster model, a closer look reveals stark differences between the two, as seen in the case of parliamentary sovereignty.",

But its usage in the recent past has been drastically reduced due to various political and legal factors.\n\n**Factors for reduced frequency**\n\n* **S.R Bommai Case:** This iconic case made the use of Article 356 more challenging.\n  + It made the decision to impose the Article subject to judicial review and made \u2018material evidence necessary\u2019 to justify President\u2019s rule.\n  + Finally, it provided the Court with the power to restore the state legislature if it isn't satisfied with the reasoning for the application of the Article in a state.\n* **Inter-Sate Councils:** Their formation made relation between state and centre more cordial.\n* **Coalition Politics:** With its emergence, the parties at the centre had to be more accommodative of the regional parties that were impowering the various other parties at the centre.\n* **Rise of Regional Parties:** With the rise of strong regional political parties, misuse of Article 356 by the union government became increasingly difficult.\n\nThe reduced usage of Article 356 by application of various political and legal matters has made India a healthier, more federal democracy.",

        "explanation": "Civil society refers to the communities and groups that function outside government to provide support and advocacy for certain people and/or issues in society. They work behind the curtains to influence policy making. In a nation as big as India, voluntary citizen groups are necessary to bring significant changes.\n\n**Contributions**\n\n* **Raising Awareness:** Civil society groups have educated the masses in small batches to build up necessary awareness at the grass-root level. Various initiatives by small groups have been taken in this regard like \u201850% reservation\u2019.\n* **Policy Changes:** These organizations provide legislative push via pressure groups to influence policy making by the legislature. They are also involved in research and data collection to identify key problem areas, and work on them specifically.\n* **Capacity Building:** These groups have been providing training to women and helping them build up necessary skills to participate in the legislative process. Civil groups also create platforms for women leaders to come and collectively strategize for greater political participation.\n\nTherefore, the effects of civil society groups on the legislative process of India cannot be undermined. The passing of the \u2018Women Reservation Bill, 2023\u2019 is a testimony to the positive effects that civil groups have on the nation.",

GST consolidated the various taxes on goods and services into a single tax, thereby simplifying taxation across supply chain.\n\n**Significance of the Act**\n\n* **Subsumed Various Indirect Taxes:** All taxes such as service tax, excise tax etc. are all subsumed under GST, thereby unifying the taxation in India.\n* **Reduced Compliance Burden**: Calculation of tax has become easy under the GST regime therefore reducing the burden of compliance.\n* **Simplifying Tax Administration:** Redundancies and duplication of efforts has been greatly reduced therefore simplifying taxation.\n* **Increased Ease of Doing Business:** Taxation in few states and of certain types used to be a cumbersome process which has now been transferred online.\n* **Cascading Effect of Taxes:** Levying of tax at every stage of production and therefore taxing a taxed product was done away with.\n* **Destination-based Taxation:** Unlike Value Added Tax (VAT) which used to be charged at instance of manufacturing or selling, GST is a destination-based taxation system.\n\n**The Act and Federalism**\n\n* The Act came with a provision wherein the states were compensated for any loss that they incurred due to implementation of GST.\n* The GST Council comprises of members from both Centre and State and decisions are based on consensus, therefore reinforcing cooperative federalism.\n* Increased revenue due to GST has ensured more finances for both union and state governments helping develop more infrastructure.\n* Inter-state barrier to trade have been greatly reduced by GST, therefore allowing business to operate across the country with much less hassle.\n\nThe 101st Constitution Amendment Act, by implementing Goods and Services Tax has greatly helped with ease of doing business across states. The increased revenue for states and union government allows for strengthening of federalism in the country with the objective of one nation, one tax.",

It audits the report of Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG).\n  + It ensures financial accountability of the executive and scrutinises government schemes and projects. For example, the 2G spectrum allocation.\n\nThe financial committees have over the years proved to be of importance to the proper working and institutionalisation of the Parliament.

India will benefit from trade relations from these countries and additionally from the politico-economic stability that is brought about by their partnership.\n* **Democratic Values:** Shared ideological values of democracy that are being upheld by these groupings aligns with India's interest as contrasted against its two hostile neighbours.\n* **Defence Capabilities:** Increased engagement with the western military, will benefit India in terms of technological know-how, advanced military trainings, and strategic collaboration.\n* **Tackling Terrorism:** India being a country with history of dealing with terrorist attacks would greatly appreciate any effort towards ending or at least mitigating terrorism which would be an indirect benefit of the US-Europe strategic partnership.\n\n**Few challenges**\n\n* **India-Russia Relations:** A closeness with the western countries would have to be done in a way that does not offend India's relationship with its long-term partner, Russia. Balancing between USA and Russia is a test of Indian diplomacy.\n* **Increased Competition:** A stronger EU and US relationship would mean an increased competition in sectors where India is trying to grow, e.g., IT industry and pharmaceuticals.\n\nOverall, India would benefit immensely from a strengthened NATO and a stronger US-Europe strategic partnership if it can tackle the challenges that come with it.",
