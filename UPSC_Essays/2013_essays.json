      "Be the Change You Want to See in Others – Gandhiji\n\nThe frail, dhoti-clad Mahatma, spinning his charkha, might seem a world away from the gleaming skyscrapers and digital highways of 21st-century India. Yet, his simple dictum, “Be the change you want to see in others,” resonates with an almost prophetic power, a timeless sutra (thread) weaving its way through the complex tapestry of our nation’s journey.  Remember that sweltering afternoon in Pietermaritzburg station when a young Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was thrown off a train? That singular act of injustice ignited a fire, not of vengeance, but of transformative change, a change that began within.  Isn’t that the crux of Bapu’s message?  Before we demand transformation from the world, we must first embody it ourselves.\n\nThis philosophy, deeply rooted in ancient Indian wisdom – “Atmavat sarvabhuteshu” (seeing oneself in all beings) – finds expression in our Constitution’s preamble, promising justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity.  But how can we truly achieve these lofty ideals if we ourselves fail to live them?  Consider, for instance, the Directive Principles of State Policy. They urge us towards a welfare state, but can the state truly deliver if we, as citizens, don’t embrace the spirit of social responsibility?  I recall visiting a small village in Odisha where, despite government schemes, sanitation remained a challenge.  It was only when a group of young women, inspired by Gandhi’s ideals of Swachh Bharat, took it upon themselves to lead a cleanliness drive, that the village truly transformed.\n\nFrom the snow-capped Himalayas of Ladakh, where solar energy is powering remote villages, to the coastal hamlets of Kerala, where Kudumbashree empowers women, examples abound of individuals and communities embodying Gandhi’s message.  The Amul cooperative movement in Gujarat, born from the ashes of exploitation, stands as a testament to the power of collective action, echoing the Mahatma’s vision of Gram Swaraj (village self-governance).  These initiatives, however small they may seem, are like drops in the ocean, contributing to the larger wave of progress envisioned in our Five-Year Plans.\n\nHowever, let’s not romanticise the past.  Gandhi’s philosophy is not without its challenges in today’s world.  Some might argue that his emphasis on individual morality is inadequate to address systemic issues like corruption or inequality.  There’s some truth in that, I suppose.  But isn’t addressing systemic issues also about changing the mindset that perpetuates them?  Take, for instance, the recent push towards digital transactions. While the government implemented the infrastructure, it was the change in individual behaviour, the willingness to embrace new technology, that truly fueled its success.  It's like the old saying, \"You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink.\"\n\nMoreover, Gandhi’s emphasis on non-violence, ahimsa, might seem impractical in a world riddled with conflict.  Yet, even in the face of aggression, his philosophy offers a powerful alternative. The Chipko movement, where women hugged trees to protect them from felling, stands as a powerful testament to the strength of non-violent resistance. This resonates with the ancient Tamil concept of ‘ahimsa paramo dharma’ – non-violence is the supreme dharma.\n\nThe journey towards becoming the change we wish to see is not a linear one.  It is fraught with challenges, setbacks, and internal contradictions. We may stumble, we may falter, but the important thing is to keep moving forward, guided by the lamp of our conscience, much like the Dandi marchers, one step at a time.\n\nGandhi’s philosophy is not merely a set of moral precepts; it is a pragmatic roadmap for nation-building.  It calls upon each of us, from the corridors of power to the dusty lanes of our villages, to become active participants in the project of creating a better India.  It reminds us that true progress is not just about economic growth or technological advancement, but about building a society founded on the bedrock of justice, compassion, and ethical conduct. As we celebrate Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav, let us rededicate ourselves to this timeless ideal, striving to be the change we wish to see, not just in others, but within ourselves.  After all, isn’t that the true essence of Swaraj – self-rule?\n"

    "essay": [
      "Is the Colonial Mentality Hindering India’s Success?\n\nThe old banyan tree in my village, its roots digging deep into the earth, its branches reaching for the sky – a silent witness to centuries of change.  It has seen the Mughals, the British, and now, a resurgent India.  But has the shade of colonialism truly left us?  Has the insidious creep of a colonial mentality, like a persistent weed, stifled our growth, preventing us from reaching our full potential?  This, indeed, is a question that deserves our deepest contemplation.\n\nThe legacy of the British Raj is a complex tapestry woven with threads of both progress and exploitation.  We inherited a robust administrative system, the railways, and the English language, which has undoubtedly connected us to the global stage.  Yet, the psychological scars run deep.  “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam,” the ancient Sanskrit phrase reminding us that the world is one family, seemed to fade into the background as we internalised the divisive narratives of the colonisers.  This instilled a sense of inferiority, a yearning for Western validation, which, even today, subtly influences our choices, from consumer goods to education systems.  We see this manifested in the “fairness” cream obsession, the craze for foreign brands, and the persistent brain drain.\n\nTake, for example, the North-East.  Geographically remote, culturally distinct, this region has often been viewed through a colonial lens, its rich traditions and indigenous knowledge systems disregarded, its people marginalized.  Similar narratives of othering can be observed in the tribal belts of Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, and Odisha.  This internal colonialism, a mirror image of the British Raj, continues to impede our progress towards a truly inclusive society.  The Directive Principles of State Policy, enshrined in our Constitution, call for the promotion of the educational and economic interests of the weaker sections of the people, particularly the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.  However, the ground reality often falls short of this constitutional ideal.\n\nThe colonial mentality also manifests in our bureaucratic structures.  The red tape, the hierarchical systems, the tendency towards centralized control – these are all remnants of the colonial administration.  While reforms like e-governance and decentralization are underway, the mindset shift required for truly transformative change is still a work in progress.  The Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan, a clarion call for self-reliance, is a step in the right direction, but it needs to permeate every level of our society, from government offices to village panchayats.\n\nHowever, it would be intellectually dishonest to lay all our shortcomings at the doorstep of colonialism.  Corruption, social inequalities, and environmental degradation are challenges we must confront, irrespective of our colonial past.  As Swami Vivekananda said, \"Strength is life, weakness is death.\"  We must draw strength from our rich cultural heritage, our philosophical traditions, and the resilience of our people.\n\nThe success stories of states like Kerala, with its high literacy rates and robust public health system, and Gujarat, with its focus on industrial development, demonstrate that progress is possible when we prioritize local needs and leverage our strengths.  The recent focus on millets, promoting traditional crops and empowering farmers, is a testament to our ability to reclaim our narrative.  The National Education Policy 2020, with its emphasis on holistic development and vocational training, is another promising step.\n\nBut the journey is far from over.  Like the mythical phoenix, India must rise from the ashes of its colonial past, embracing its own unique identity, its “swadeshi” spirit.  We must question the ingrained biases, challenge the status quo, and create a society that reflects the true spirit of our Constitution – a society that is just, equitable, and inclusive.  \"Arise, awake, and stop not till the goal is reached,\" as Swami Vivekananda exhorted.  Let us, therefore, shed the shackles of the colonial mindset and stride confidently towards a future where India takes its rightful place on the world stage, not as an imitator, but as a leader, a beacon of hope, a shining example of “sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas, sabka prayas.”\n"

      "GDP along with GDH would be the right indices for judging the well-being of a country.\n\nA wizened old woman in a remote Ladakh village once told me, “Happiness isn’t a full stomach, it’s a full heart.”  Her words, simple yet profound, encapsulate the essence of this debate – can GDP, a cold, hard number, truly capture the well-being of a nation?  While GDP, the monetary value of all finished goods and services produced within a country’s borders, has long been the yardstick of progress, its limitations are increasingly evident.  Shouldn't we, like that Ladakhi woman, consider the \"fullness of heart,\" the Gross Domestic Happiness (GDH), alongside the fullness of our coffers?  I believe we must.\n\nThe pursuit of economic growth, reflected in a rising GDP, has undeniably lifted millions out of poverty, funded crucial infrastructure projects like the Bharatmala Pariyojana, and propelled India onto the global stage.  From the bustling IT hubs of Bengaluru to the burgeoning manufacturing corridors of Gujarat, the fruits of economic progress are palpable.  However, this single-minded focus on GDP has created a chasm between material prosperity and societal well-being.  The farmer in Vidarbha, burdened by debt and crop failure, the migrant labourer in Mumbai, toiling in inhuman conditions – their struggles remain invisible in the gleaming edifice of GDP growth.  As Thiruvalluvar, the celebrated Tamil poet, wrote in the Thirukkural, \"What profits a kingdom if it has no subjects happy and content?\"\n\nThe concept of GDH, championed by Bhutan, offers a refreshing counterpoint.  It encompasses nine domains, including psychological well-being, health, education, good governance, and ecological diversity – a holistic approach that resonates deeply with our ancient Indian philosophy.  The Upanishads, for instance, emphasize the importance of 'Anand', or bliss, as the ultimate human pursuit.  Our Constitution, too, reflects this wisdom, enshrining in its Directive Principles the goal of securing a social order for the promotion of the welfare of the people.  Isn't this, in essence, a call for maximizing GDH?\n\nIntegrating GDH into our national narrative requires a paradigm shift. It necessitates moving beyond the \"trickle-down\" theory and embracing a more inclusive model of development.  The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), while sometimes criticised for its implementation flaws, represents a step in this direction, providing a safety net for rural households and contributing to rural infrastructure development.  Similarly, initiatives like the Ayushman Bharat Yojana, aimed at providing affordable healthcare, demonstrate a commitment to social welfare.  However, more needs to be done.  We need to invest heavily in education, mental health services, and environmental protection – areas that directly contribute to GDH.\n\nConsider Kerala, a state often cited for its high social development indicators despite a relatively modest GDP.  Its robust public health system, high literacy rates, and strong social safety nets have created a society where people generally enjoy a higher quality of life.  Similarly, Sikkim's focus on organic farming and sustainable tourism showcases how economic growth can be aligned with ecological preservation, contributing to both GDP and GDH.  These examples, while not without their challenges, offer valuable lessons for the nation.\n\nOf course, some might argue that GDH is a nebulous concept, difficult to quantify and prone to subjective interpretations.  How do you measure happiness, after all?  While these concerns are valid, they shouldn't deter us from exploring the potential of GDH.  Several methodologies, including surveys and qualitative assessments, have been developed to measure GDH, and while they may not be perfect, they offer a starting point.  Perhaps, a more decentralised approach, allowing states and local communities to define and measure GDH based on their unique contexts, could be more effective.  “Ati sarvatra varjayet” – excess of anything is bad, even the pursuit of a single metric like GDP.\n\nIn conclusion, while GDP remains an important indicator of economic progress, it is not the sole determinant of a nation’s well-being.  Just as a raga is incomplete without both “sur” and “taal”,  our development narrative must harmonize the pursuit of economic growth with the pursuit of happiness and well-being.  By embracing GDH alongside GDP, we can create a more just, equitable, and fulfilling society, one that truly lives up to the ideals enshrined in our Constitution and resonates with the wisdom of our ancient heritage.  This, I believe, is the path to true national progress – a path that leads not just to a richer India, but a happier one too.\n"

      "Science and Technology: A Panacea for National Growth and Security?\n\nMy grandfather, a farmer in rural Maharashtra, used to say, \"ज़मीन की बात ज़मीन समझती है\" (The land understands the language of the land).  He relied on traditional wisdom passed down through generations. Today, his grandson, armed with a soil testing kit and a smartphone app, makes informed decisions about crop management. This anecdote encapsulates the evolving relationship between tradition and technology in India, a nation grappling with the complexities of development in the 21st century. While science and technology offer immense potential for national growth and security, declaring them a complete panacea requires a nuanced examination.\n\nUndeniably, scientific advancements are the bedrock of progress. From the Green Revolution, which addressed food security concerns, to the Chandrayaan missions, which ignited national pride, India’s journey has been punctuated by technological leaps. Initiatives like the Digital India programme, aiming to bridge the digital divide, and the Atal Innovation Mission, fostering a culture of entrepreneurship, exemplify the government’s commitment to leveraging technology for national development.  These are not mere slogans but reflect a genuine attempt to uplift millions from the throes of poverty and empower them with the tools of the digital age.  Furthermore, advancements in biotechnology, nanotechnology, and artificial intelligence hold immense promise for addressing challenges in healthcare, agriculture, and manufacturing.  Remember the success of the polio eradication programme? A testament to the power of scientific intervention.\n\nHowever, technology is a double-edged sword. The same digital tools that connect us can also be used for misinformation and cyber warfare.  The rapid pace of technological change can exacerbate existing inequalities, creating a digital divide between the haves and have-nots.  In the rush towards a technologically advanced future, we must not forget the “antyodaya” principle, ensuring that the benefits of progress reach the last person in the queue. The north-eastern states, often lagging in infrastructure, present a unique challenge.  Bridging this gap requires targeted interventions, acknowledging the specific geographical and socio-cultural contexts.\n\nMoreover, security in the modern age transcends traditional notions of military might.  Cybersecurity, data privacy, and bio-security are emerging as critical concerns.  The recent surge in cyberattacks underscores the vulnerability of our digital infrastructure.  The question then arises: Can technology truly be a panacea for security when it simultaneously creates new vulnerabilities?  Perhaps, the answer lies in a holistic approach.  Just as our ancient texts emphasized the importance of “धर्म” (righteous conduct), we must ensure that technological advancements are guided by ethical considerations and a commitment to the greater good.\n\nThe Directive Principles of State Policy, enshrined in our Constitution, mandate the state to promote the welfare of its citizens.  This includes providing access to education, healthcare, and a clean environment.  Science and technology can be instrumental in achieving these goals.  The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, with its focus on sanitation and hygiene, demonstrates how technology can be leveraged for social good.  Similarly, initiatives like the National Health Mission are striving to improve healthcare outcomes, particularly in rural areas.\n\nYet, technological solutions alone cannot address the deep-rooted societal issues that plague our nation.  Poverty, inequality, and social discrimination require a multi-pronged approach, encompassing social reforms, economic empowerment, and educational upliftment.  As Swami Vivekananda said, \"Strength is life, weakness is death.\"  We must strive to build a nation that is not only technologically advanced but also socially just and equitable.\n\nIn conclusion, while science and technology are not a magical cure-all, they are undoubtedly powerful tools for national growth and security.  The challenge lies in harnessing these tools responsibly, ensuring that the benefits of progress are shared by all sections of society.  We must remember the wisdom of our ancestors, who lived in harmony with nature, while embracing the possibilities of the future.  Perhaps, the true panacea lies not in technology alone, but in a synthesis of traditional wisdom and modern science, guided by ethical principles and a commitment to “sarvodaya” – the upliftment of all.  This is the only way to ensure a secure and prosperous future for our nation.\n"
