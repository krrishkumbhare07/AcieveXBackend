Until man’s nature changes, his physical needs will  always arise, and miseries will always be felt, and no amount of  physical help will remove them completely.

Let men have light, let them be pure and spiritually strong and educated; then alone will misery cease in the world.

Steady reforms since 1991 have led to growing linkages and integration of the Indian economy and its  financial system with the global economy. Weak global economic prospects and continuing uncertainties in the international financial markets therefore, have had their impact on the emerging market economies. Sovereign risk concerns, particularly in the Euro area, affected financial markets for the greater part of  the year, with the contagion of Greece’s soveregin debt problem spreading to India and other economies by way of higher- than-normal levels of volatility.    The funding constraints in international financial markets  could impact both the availability and cost of foreign funding for banks and corporates. Since the Indian financial system is bank dominated, banks’ ability to withstand stress is critical to  overall financial stability. Indian banks, however, remain robust, notwithstanding a decline in capital to risk-weighted assets  ratio and a rise in non-performing asset levels in the recent past. Capital adequacy levels remain above the regulatory requirements. The financial market infrastructure continues to function without any major disruption. With further globalization, consolidation, deregulation, and diversification of the financial system, the banking business may become more complex and riskier.

Your answers to these items should be based on the passage only.      PASSAGE    Financial markets in India have acquired greater depth and  liquidity over the years. Steady reforms since 1991 have led to growing linkages and integration of the Indian economy and its  financial system with the global economy. Weak global economic prospects and continuing uncertainties in the international financial markets therefore, have had their impact on the emerging market economies. Sovereign risk concerns, particularly in the Euro area, affected financial markets for the greater part of  the year, with the contagion of Greece’s soveregin debt problem spreading to India and other economies by way of higher- than-normal levels of volatility.    The funding constraints in international financial markets  could impact both the availability and cost of foreign funding for banks and corporates. Since the Indian financial system is bank dominated, banks’ ability to withstand stress is critical to  overall financial stability. Indian banks, however, remain robust, notwithstanding a decline in capital to risk-weighted assets  ratio and a rise in non-performing asset levels in the recent past.

Such hydrocarbons are also found in other forms such as  bitumen, asphalt and natural gas. Mineral oil originates from the  carcasses of tiny animals and from plants that live in the sea.
