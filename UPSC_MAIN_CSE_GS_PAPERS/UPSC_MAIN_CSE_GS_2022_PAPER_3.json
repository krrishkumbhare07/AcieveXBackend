        "explanation": "* Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) are a mechanism for government to procure and implement public infrastructure and services using the resources and expertise of the private sector.\n\n#### **PPP in Infrastructure Projects**\n\n* Governments in developing countries face the challenge to meet the growing demand for better infrastructure services. Introduction of PPP will help in providing better infrastructure services through improved operational efficiency.\n* The funding available and capacity of public sector to implement project on time remains limited, partnership with the private sector is an attractive alternative to increase and improve the supply of infrastructure services.\n* PPPs are beneficial in supplementing limited public sector capacities to meet the growing demand for infrastructure development.\n* It will develop local private sector through joint ventures with large firms in areas such as: civil works, electrical works, facilities management, security services, cleaning services, maintenance services.\n* The long-term value-for-money is extracted through appropriate risk transfer to the private sector over the life of the project \u2013 from construction to operations.\n\n#### **Role of PPP model in the redevelopment of Railway Stations in India**\n\n* The station redevelopment comprises two components:  \n  + **Mandatory station redevelopment:** It will make smooth and hassle-free travel.\n  + **Station Estate (Commercial) development:** It will enable to tap several revenue streams to ensure the viability of entire project.\n* The Government of India pushing for reforms in railway infrastructure with the help of PPP. The first station redeveloped through PPP process is Gandhinagar in Gujarat.\n* Other stations will be redeveloped such as New Delhi, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus and many more including in tier 2 and tier 3 cities.\n* The responsibility of train operations and safety certification rests with Indian Railways.\n\nPPPs offer the public sector potential cost, quality, and scale advantages in achieving infrastructure service targets. NITI Aayog strategy for new India @ 75 envisages many targets in railway infrastructure like increasing the speed of infrastructure from the present 7 km/day to 19 km/day, 100% electrification of broad-gauge track by 2022-23.",

        "explanation": "In a market economy, the production of goods and services is directed by the laws of supply and demand and by profit with no government intervention.\n\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) defines inclusive growth as economic growth that is distributed fairly across society and creates opportunities for all.\n\nAchieving inclusive growth in a market economy is a difficult prospect.\n\n* The absence of government intervention does not leave any substantial scope for social welfare schemes.\n* The profit-driven efficient utilisation does not take into consideration the deprivations faced by the marginalised sections of the population.\n* This often results in the further socio-economic weakening of these sections such as job loss, etc.\n* Market economy encourages privatisation, which in an unregulated manner, can prove to be detrimental to a large section of the population (high education fees and exorbitant prices of vaccines, essential medicines, etc.).\n\nFinancial Inclusion is the process of ensuring access to financial services for vulnerable groups at affordable costs.\n\n* The government has initiated several schemes such as PM Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) and PM Mudra Yojana (PMJY) aimed at effecting financial inclusion in the country.  \n  + These schemes are primarily to increase the coverage of the formal financial services in the country and enable a larger number of people to join the economic mainstream.\n* The integration of a greater number of people into the formal economic system of the country and the development of the habit of saving which further contributes to economic growth.\n* Extension of loans (PM Mudra Yojana) is also a key part of financial inclusion. With the availability of capital, more MSMEs, start-ups, etc., can be established that can play a crucial role in economic growth.\n* Pension-related schemes (Atal Pension Yojana, etc.) also constitute a key part of financial inclusion. This allows the elderly population of the country to remain economically productive and allow them to lead a dignified life.\n* Technology-driven financial inclusion (UPI) can also lead to economic growth since it helps in plugging leakages and enable larger people to integrate themselves with the formal financial services in the country.\n\nThe market economy despite being economically efficient is not the ideal system for the implementation of inclusive growth which is based on equity and socio-economic welfare.",

PDS is operated under the joint responsibility of the central and the state governments.\n\nThere are many issues associated with PDS system in India:\n\n* Studies show that entitled beneficiaries are not getting food grains while those that are ineligible are getting undue benefits.\n* TPDS (Targeted PDS) suffers from large leakages of food grains during transportation.\n* Open-ended Procurement i.e., all incoming grains accepted even if buffer stock is filled, creates a shortage in the open market.\n* A performance audit by the CAG has revealed a serious shortfall in the government\u2019s storage capacity.\n\nHowever, various measures can be taken to make it effective and transparent:\n\n* Its effectiveness can be enhanced with technology-based solutions. Shifting towards DBT is another idea, but with caution.\n* Increased public participation through social audits and participation of SHGs, Cooperatives and NGOs will ensure the transparency of the PDS system at the ground level.\n* Integrating Aadhar with TPDS will help in the better identification of beneficiaries and address the problem of inclusion and exclusion errors. This will make PDS more effective.\n\nPDS is one of the biggest welfare programmes of the government. Strengthening of the existing TPDS system by capacity building and training of the implementing authorities along with efforts to plug leakages is the best way forward.",

In some cases, it is also related to the concentration of secondary pollutants (aldehydes, tropospheric ozone, and PAN).\n\n* Photochemical smog appears to be initiated by nitrogen oxides\n* Absorbing the visible or ultraviolet energy of sunlight, it forms nitric oxide (NO) to free atoms of oxygen (O), which then combine with molecular oxygen (O2) to form ozone (O3).\n* With hydrocarbons, certain other organic compounds, and sunlight, various chemical reactions take place to form photochemical smog.\n\n**Effects:**\n\n* Chemicals within it, when combined with hydrocarbons, form molecules which cause eye irritation.\n* Ground level ozone can prove to be extremely toxic to human beings.\n* Other negative symptoms include decreased vision and shortness of breath.\n* Acid rain and eutrophication.\n\n**Mitigation**\n\n* Catalytic converters can reduce vehicle emissions of nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and hydrocarbons.\n* reducing greenhouse gas emissions and noxious urban emissions from transport through Biofuels.\n* cleaner options for vehicles such as Hydrogen powered and electric vehicles\n\n**Gothenburg Protocol:**\n\n* It is to Abate Acidification, Eutrophication and Ground-level Ozone was adopted by the countries of UNECE in Gothenburg (Sweden) on 30 November 1999.\n* It is also known as Muti-effect protocol.\n* It sets emission ceilings for 2010 for four pollutants: Sulphur, NOx, VOCs and ammonia.\n* These ceilings were negotiated on the basis of scientific assessments of pollution effects and abatement options.\n\nCurrently, the protocol is under negotiation for a revised protocol. It was updated in 2012 to include particulate matter and black carbon.",

These clouds are generally associated with rain, thunder and lightning. These unstable clouds cause an intense rainstorm over a small area and locked in the ridges and valleys between the hills.\n\nOccurrence of cloudburst\n\nThe relative humidity and cloud cover is at the maximum level with low temperature and slow winds because of which clouds may get condensed at a very rapid rate and result in a cloudburst.\n\n**Recent incidents**\n\n* Amarnath Cloudburst in July 2022, which caused heavy casualties of pilgrims on yatra.\n* In August 2022, several people have been killed in destruction caused by cloudbursts and flash floods in different parts of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand.\n\nWith rising occurrences of cloudburst every year, it has become necessary to install dense network of weather instruments, and computing capabilities especially for hilly regions.",

Working from home has allowed people to dedicate more time to their respective economic engagements and vocations resulting in higher labour activity and resultantly productivity.\n\nFurther, sectors such as ed-tech and other digitally driven fields have flourished during the same period and have contributed to higher labour activity and subsequently productivity and eventually to higher economic growth.\n\nAlso, the initiative taken by the government in launching several important schemes (Skill India) aimed at the upskilling of the workforce and encouragement to the start-up ecosystem (Startup India) has resulted in the creation of a skilled and well-equipped workforce.\n\nAlso, the reinstatement of economic activities after nearly two years of Covid-induced lockdowns has led to increased labour activity and productivity.\n\nSeveral initiatives can be taken to create a growth pattern that ensures the creation of jobs without compromising labour productivity.\n\n* Manufacturing-intensive industries, the MSME sector and start-ups should be promoted to ensure the creation of an adequate number of jobs to ensure without compromising labour productivity.\n* Government, through capital expenditure can create jobs and ensure that labour productivity is not compromised.\n* Further, it can also initiate programmes aimed at upskilling the workforce as well as increasing government recruitments in a financially prudent manner.\n* A focus on automation and the introduction of new and efficient technologies is another method of maintaining labour productivity and ensuring economic growth.\n* Efforts should be made to bring those sections of the population into the mainstream workforce that have hitherto not been able to make an active contribution to labour activity.\n\nThus, increased labour activity and the resultant increase in productivity and economic growth have been important features of the post-pandemic economy. An economic growth pattern that ensures its continuation is thus very important.",

        "explanation": "India at the COP 26th meeting of the United Nations Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) committed to the 5-point agenda programme. One of them is to meet 50% of its energy requirements from renewable energy by 2030.\n\nTo reach the above commitments India has already achieved few targets:\n\n* India has overachieved its commitment made at COP 21- Paris Summit by already meeting 40% of its power capacity from non-fossil fuels.\n* India is also one of the world\u2019s largest producers of modern bioenergy.\n* Today, India is the world's third largest producer of renewable energy, with 40% of its installed electricity capacity coming from non-fossil fuel sources.\n* India's massive UJALA LED bulb campaign is reducing emissions by 40 million tonnes annually.\n\nHowever, there are a few challenges in achieving the target:\n\n* To meet the above target India will need massive funding. BlombergNEF (BNEF) report says that only to meet wind and solar energy targets India will need $223 Billion.\n* In the short-term rising interest rates, a depreciating rupee and high-inflation create challenges for the financing of renewables.\n* Even, to complete the targets Indian government needs to cut down its taxes for almost 2 lakh crores by 2030 which will effect the other sectors like education, health and infrastructure.\n\nFossil fuel subsidies by the Union government have fallen 742% since 2014 but the subsidies on coal, oil and gas increased by nine times in 2021-22. Still, the Fossil fuel subsidies in India nine times higher than renewable energy. So, there is no complete shift to subsidies on renewable energy sources.\n\nAlthough, the shift of subsidies from fossil fuels to renewables will help in subsidies for E- vehicles and raising taxes on fossil fuels will help in achieving the above objective because giving subsidies to renewable sources will make it look cheaper and this will also work against the fossil-fueled incumbents that are preventing new renewable energy entrants access to the market. For example, giving subsidies for E- vehicles and raising taxes on fossil fuels will help in achieving levels needed by 2030 as it will contain global warming to the Paris goal of 1.5-2C.",

      "solution": {
        "explanation": "Agriculture is the backbone of the Indian economy. Even, with the growth of other sectors, agriculture still continues to play a dominant part in the overall economic scenario of India. Agricultural marketing is mainly a state entitlement with the Central Government providing support under central sector schemes. The upstream process of agricultural marketing includes inputs to agriculture like seeds, machinery, and technology and the downstream process includes the food processing industry.\n\nHowever, there are still many challenges in upstream and downstream process of agricultural marketing:\n\n* In the upstream process, lack of coverage of reform policies is one of the main hindrances in addressing the issues of agricultural marketing. For example, only some States have adopted the Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (APLMA) Act fully.\n* Contract farming has been taken out of the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) domain, citing conflict of interest and this creates lacunae in the upstream as well as downstream process.\n* Another downstream bottleneck is flawed MSP provision which forces the private traders to buy produce at or above MSP or penalizing for not doing so, which can kill the private markets for agricultural produce.\n* There should be effective provision of procurement by the State and its agencies with the involvement of local institutions like Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS) and producer companies as it effects sourcing activities and purchasing activities in upstream and downstream process.\n* Most disappointingly, Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2017 (APLMA, 2017) ignores the vexed issue of the role of Arthiyas (commission agents or CAs) in the APMCs and maintains them as central agents in the system. This effects the whole agricultural marketing process.\n\nHowever, with some reforms like the removal of entry barriers, involvement of other stakeholders and electronic settlement of sales, the process of marketing of agricultural products can be improved.\n\nAddressing the challenges of the agricultural market is complex, yet doable, as the doubling of farmers\u2019 income cannot come without developing a thriving market of agriculture. Hence, it is high time that focus must shift from agricultural production to agricultural marketing.",

Thus, effective input cost is reduced. For example, cattle dung mixed with crop residues and farm waste can be converted into nutrient-rich vermicompost.\n* **Maximization of yield of all** component enterprises to provide steady and stable income at higher levels.\n* **Rejuvenation/amelioration** of systems productivity and achieve agro-ecological equilibrium.\n* Control the **built-up of insects-pest**, diseases and weeds population through natural cropping system management and keep them at low level of intensity.\n* **Reducing the use of chemical fertilizer** and other harmful agrochemicals and pesticides to provide pollution-free, healthy produce and environment to the society at large.\n* It will help in **mitigating the negative impact of agriculture** or livestock on the environment.\n* Regular **stable income** through products like egg, milk, mushroom, vegetables and silkworm cocoons etc..\n\nAccording to the Agriculture Census 2015, India has 86% small and marginal farmers, hence ensuring their livelihood is critical to ensuring inclusive growth. Small and marginal farmers should always be encouraged to implement IFS. It will also help the government achieve its aim of **doubling farmers' income** and increasing agriculture's total **GVA** to the economy at large. However, there are some limitations with the IFS:\n\n* Financial restrictions prevent small and marginal farmers from affording huge cattle or setting up ponds for fisheries.\n* Lack of awareness among farmers and hesitancy to adopt newer farming systems and technologies.\n* MSP is provided only for 23 crops. It does not apply to other crops such as Mushrooms and Beekeeping industries.\n\nIFS fulfills multiple objectives, including making farmers self-sufficient by ensuring the family members get a balanced diet, enhancing the standard of living by maximizing the total net returns and providing more jobs, overall upliftment of rural community and conserving the natural resources and crop diversity.",

        "explanation": "The process of removal of coastal sand or displacement of land because of local sea level rise, strong wave action, heavy intrusion of sea water in coastal region can be termed as coastal erosion. The Ministry of Earth Sciences informed the Lok Sabha that of the 6,907.18 km long Indian coastline of the mainland, a significant area is under varying degrees of coastal erosion.\n\nFactors responsible for coastal erosion are:\n\n* **Natural reasons**   \n  + **Global Warming-** The increase in concentration of CO2 in atmosphere has led to warming of planet and has resulted in melting of glaciers which invariably has led to rise in sea level. Thus, threat of coastal erosion has increased manifold.\n  + **Planetary cycle-** Planetary position of Earth and Moon cause tides in the sea every fortnight\n  + Strong winds that blow across the planet generate huge energy; this generated energy is released by waves on the shores breaking rocks into sand in long run.\n  + **Warming of Sea Water**- It has increased the formation of cyclones in Indian peninsula and contribute to destruction of coastal areas.\n* **Anthropological reasons**   \n  + Violation of Coastal Management Zones (CMZ) rules by builders\n  + Energy production near coastal areas like nuclear energy, tidal energy plant\n  + Dredging at shallow waters near coasts\n  + Reduced flow of sand from river into ocean\n* **Effect of coastal erosion are:**  \n  + Rise of sea level has increased the threat submergence of small islands.\n  + Destruction of coastal habitats thus increases vulnerability of coastal flora and fauna.\n  + Loss of income from coastal ecosystems.\n\n**Major coastal management techniques to prevent erosion are:**\n\n**Natural response**\n\n* Coastal Shelter belts such as mangroves, coral reefs and lagoons are recognized as the best defence against sea storms and erosion, deflecting and absorbing much of the energy of sea storms. Therefore, it is important to maintain these natural habitats for shore protection as well as for environmental conservation.\n\n**Artificial response**\n\n* **Use of Geo-synthetic Tubes / Bags-** Geo-synthetic tube is a sizable, tube-shaped bag filled with sand slurry and fashioned with porous, weather-resistant geotextile that is used to create artificial coastal structures like breakwaters, dunes, or levees. They are aligned with the shoreline to weaken wave energy and protect against coastal erosion\n* **Artificial Beach Nourishment-** Often referred to as a \u201csoft armoring\u201d technique, beach nourishment, or beach filling technique is the practice of adding large quantities of sand or sediment to beaches to combat erosion and increase beach width.\n* **Groynes -** An active structure that protrudes into the sea from the shore and is often perpendicular to or slightly oblique to the shoreline is called a groyne. A groyne's primary job is to catch and hold back some of the sediment that is travelling through the surf zone, mostly in a longshore direction.\n\nWith the alarming rise in climate change threats, rising sea level is a certain outcome of the process. As coastal areas across India are densely populated, it has become quintessential that coastal planning is given concrete thought by considering the option of displacement of people to safe havens.",

The Naxal Movement started in 1967 under the leadership of Kanu Sanyal and Jagan Santhal as a rebellion against the local landlords over a land dispute. The movement was spread across the eastern Indian and in less developed states like Odisha, Chhattisgarh, and Andhra Pradesh.\n\n**Emerging Issues**\n\n* The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 deprives tribal to depend upon forests produces and there is a massive displacement of tribal population due to developmental and mining projects.\n* The administration fails to provide essential services to the people of Naxalite affected regions such as education, freedom, sanitation, and food. There is a confusion over tackling Naxalism as a social issue or as a security threat.\n* Some villages suffer with infrastructural problems such as communication and connectivity. There is absence of technical intelligence to fight with Naxalites.\n* Lack of political participation by the tribal community and the inability of political authority to provide avenues for structural uplift to the deprived sections.\n\n**Strategy to Tackle the Menace of Naxalism**\n\n**Social Dimensions**\n\n* Aspirational District Programme deals with Left Wing Extremism (LWE) in a holistic manner for ensuring rights and entitlements of local communities and improvement in governance and management.\n* Security Related Expenditure (SRE) Scheme is implemented by the Central Government to reimburses needs of security forces like ex-gratia payment to the family of civilians/security forces killed/injured in LWE violence, compensation to Left Wing Extremist cadres who surrendered in accordance with the surrender and rehabilitation policy.\n* The government should initiate more dialogues between the Naxalites and the government officials. Equal participation in casting votes and contesting elections can make the conditions better.\n* Providing access to the basic resources such as forests, education, sanitation, and food. There is a need to emphasis on rehabilitation and resettlement of the affected population.\n\n**Economic Dimensions**\n\n* Removing economic disparity could contribute to tackle the growth of Naxalism.\n* Generation of more employment with higher wages will help the people of that region in uplifting their skills.\n* There is a need of coherent national strategy to be implemented by Central Government to end Naxalism.\n\n**Developmental Dimensions**\n\n* Road Connectivity Project for LWE affected areas (RCPLWE) is implemented for further improving road connectivity in LWE affected States.\n* LWE Mobile Tower Project is implemented to improve mobile connectivity in the LWE areas.\n* The concern of infrastructure needs to be addressed in the Naxalite affected regions.\n\nIndia has made little success tackling Naxalism, but the root causes have not been addressed yet. The central and the State Governments should continue to work together and come up with common strategy.",
