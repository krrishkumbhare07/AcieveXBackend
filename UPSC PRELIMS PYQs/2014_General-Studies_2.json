At the opposite end, rural  roads, whose sparse traffic makes tolling unviable, have to be on  the balance-sheet of the State. If the government did not own  rural roads, they would not exist. Similarly, public health capital  in our towns and cities will need to come from the public sector. Equally, preservation and improvement of forest cover will have to be a new priority for the public sector assets.   Take the example of steel. With near-zero tariffs, India is a globally competitive market for the metal. Indian firms  export steel into the global market, which demonstrates there is no gap  in technology. Indian companies are buying up global steel companies, which shows there is no gap in capital  availability. Under these conditions, private ownership works best.    Private ownership is clearly desirable in regulated industries, ranging from finance to infrastructure, where a government agency performs the function of regulation and multiple competing firms are located in the private sector. Here, the simple and clean solution - government as the umpire and the private sector as the players is what works best. In many of these industries, we have a legacy of government ownership, where productivity tends to be lower, fear of bankruptcy is absent, and the risk of asking for money from the tax payer is ever present. There is also the conflict  of interest between government as an owner and as the regulator. The formulation and implementation of competition policy will be more vigorous and fair if government companies are out of action.",

Cynthia nearly died  of fright when she was told that she would have to stand on  stage in front of the entire class and deliver dialogues. The mere  thought  of it made her feel sick. But a remarkable transformation  occurred  during the audition. A thin, shy girl, her knees quaking, her stomach churning in terror, began to stun everyone with her excellent performance. Her bored classmates suddenly stopped their noisy chat to stare at her slender figure on the stage. At the end of her audition, the entire room erupted in thunderous applause.",

While the overall parameters of climate change are increasingly accepted - a 1°C average temperature increase over the next 30 years, sea level rise of less than 10 cm in the same period, and regional monsoon variations and corresponding droughts - the impacts in India are likely to be quite site and crop specific. Some crops may respond favourably to the changing conditions, others may not. This emphasizes the need to promote agricultural research and create maximum flexibility in the system to permit adaptations.   The key ingredient for “drought proofing” is the managed recharge of aquifers. To ensure continued yields of important staple crops (e.g. wheat), it may also be necessary to shift the locations where these crops are grown, in response to temperature changes as well as to water availability. The latter will be a key factor in making long term investment decisions.  For example, water runoff from the Himalayas is predicted to increase over the next 30 years as glaciers melt, but then decline substantially thereafter.

Mitigation would require a major shift in the way we produce and  consume energy. A shift away from overwhelming dependence on fossil fuels is now long overdue, but unfortunately, technological development has been slow and inadequate largely because government policies have not promoted investments in  research and development, myopically as a result of relatively low  prices of oil. It is now, therefore, imperative for a country like India  treating the opportunity of harnessing renewable energy on a large  scale as a national imperative. This country is extremely well  endowed with solar, wind and biomass sources of energy. Where we  have lagged, unfortunately, is in our ability to develop and to create technological solutions for harnessing these resources.

The cost  associated with such a trajectory is truly modest and would amount, in the estimation of IPCC, to not more than 3 percent of the global  GDP in 2030. In other words, the level of prosperity that the  world would have reached without mitigation would at worst be postponed by a few months or a year at the most.

Your answers to these items should be based  on the passages only.     Passage - 1   In recent times, India has grown fast not only compared to its own past but also incomparison with other nations. But there cannot be any room for complacency because it is possible for the Indian economy to develop even faster and also to spread the benefits of this growth more widely than has been done thus far. Before going into details of the kinds of micro-structural changes that we need to conceptualize and then proceed to implement, it is worthwhile    elaborating on the idea of inclusive growth that constitutes the defining concept behind this Government's various economic policies and decisions. A nation interested in inclusive growth views the same growth differently depending on whether the gains of the growth are heaped primarily on a small segment or shared widely by the population. The latter is cause for celebration but not the former. In other words, growth must not be treated as an end in itself but as an instrument for spreading prosperity to all. India's own past experience and the experience of other nations suggests that growth is necessary for eradicating poverty but it is not a sufficient condition. In other words, policies for promoting growth need to be complemented with policies to ensure that more and more people join in the growth process and, further, that there are mechanisms inplace to redistribute some of the gains to those who are unable to partake in the market process and, hence, get left behind.   A simple way of giving this idea of inclusive growth a sharper form is to measure a nation's progress in terms of the progress of its poorest segment, for instance the bottom 20 per cent of the population. One could measure the per capita income of the bottom quintile of the population and also calculate the growth rate of income; and evaluate our economic success in terms of these measures that pertain to the poorest segment. This approach is attractive because it does not ignore growth like some of the older heterodox criteria did. It simply looks at the growth of income of the poorest sections of the population. It also ensures that those who are outside of the bottom quintile do not get ignored. If that were done, then those people would in all likelihood drop down into the  bottom quintile and so would automatically become a direct target of our policies. Hence the criterion being suggested here is a statistical summing up of the idea of inclusive growth, which, in turn, leads to two corollaries : to wish that India must strive to achieve high growth and that we must work to ensure that the weakest segments benefit from the growth.",

Passage - 1  The Himalayan ecosystem is highly vulnerable to damage, both due to geological reasons and on account of the stress caused by increased pressure of population, exploitation of natural resources and other related challenges. These aspects may be exacerbated due to the impact of climate change. It is possible that climate change may adversely impact the Himalayan ecosystem  through increased temperature, altered precipitation patterns,  episodes of drought and biotic influences. This would not only impact the very sustenance of the indigenous communities in uplands  but also the life of downstream dwellers across the country and beyond. Therefore, there is an urgent need for giving special attention to sustain the Himalayan ecosystem. This would  require conscious efforts for conserving all the representative  systems.    Further, it needs to be emphasized that the endemics with restricted distribution, and most often with specialized habitat requirements, are among the most vulnerable elements. In  this respect the Himalayan biodiversity hotspot, with rich endemic diversity, is vulnerable to climate change. The threats include possible loss of genetic resources and species, habitats and concomitantly a decrease in ecosystem services. Therefore, conservation of endemic elements inrepresentative  ecosystems/ habitats assumes a great significance while drawing  conservation plans for the region.  Towards achieving the above, we will have to shift toward contemporary conservation approaches, which include a  paradigm of landscape level interconnectivity between protected area systems.
