Your answers to these items should be based on the passages only.     PASSAGE - 1   The richer States have a responsibility to cut down carbon emissions and promote clean energy investments. These are  the States that got electricity, grew faster and now have high per capita income, making them capable of sharing India's burden  of becoming eco-friendly. Delhi, for example, can help by  generating its own clean electricity using solar rooftop panels or even help poor States finance their clean energy projects. It is no secret that State Electricity Boards, which control 95% of the distribution network, are neck-deep in losses. These losses further  discourage State utilities from adopting renewable energy as it is more expensive than fossil fuels.",

Discretionary powers to the administration can be done away with. It is becoming more and more difficult to keep this  power within limits as the government has many number of tasks to perform. Where discretion has to be used, there must be rules and safeguards to prevent misuse of that power. Systems  have to be devised which minimise, if not prevent, the abuse of discretionary power. Government work must be conducted   within a framework of recognised rules and principles, and decisions should be similar and predictable.",
