        "explanation": "Globalization means gradual integration of economics through free movements of goods, services and capital. Globalization increased the efficiency of economy multi-dimensionally but one of the major challenges posed by globalization is the growing tendency towards flexible employment and informalisation. The reasons behind the reduction of employment due to globalisation in formal sector are following.\n\n* Increased automation in industries: Globalization exposed the technology globally which led to replacement of man power with robotics and other technology.\n* Shift from labour intensive industries to technology intensive industries: In India only 2% labour is skilled in comparison to 96% skilled labour in South Korea. Due to arrival of technology, unskilled labour was forced out from formal sector due to incapability of handling the new machines and led to informalisation.\n* Globalization encourages sub contracting of work to the informal sector because of low wage and lost cost of production in informal section. It increased the participation of contract labour in economy and reduced formal sector\u2019s employment.\n* Globalization increased competition among the industries which shifted the employment/industrial units from non-competitive countries to market favoured economics. The shifting of textile industries to the Vietnam, Laos are recent examples of this phenomenon.\n\n**Impact of informalisation on the development of the country**\n\n* Less revenue generation: Due to high informalisation, tax to GDP ratio remains very low. In case of India it is only 16.6% whereas more than 30% in OECD countries.\n* Less coverage of social security schemes: Nearly all government schemes, programmes related to social security benefits are restricted to formal sector. A huge section of population remains out of the ambit of benefits. It ultimately reduces the efficiency of economy.\n\nThis shows how informalisation of labour force has proven detrimental to the development.",

        "explanation": "Gender budget is concerned with gender sensitive formulation of legislation, programmes and schemes to address gender disparities.\n\nThe rationale for gender budgeting arises from recognition of the fact that national budgets impact men and women differently through the pattern of resource allocation. Women, constitute 48% of India\u2019s population, but they lag behind men on many social indicators like health, education, economic opportunities, etc. Hence, they warrant special attention due to their vulnerability and lack of access to resources. The way Government budgets allocate resources, has the potential to transform these gender inequalities. In view of this, Gender Budgeting, as a tool for achieving gender mainstreaming, has been propagated.\n\nTherefore number of schemes, programmes specific to women education, women health and skill training should have more weightage then partial allocation of funds for gender specific issues.\n\n**Status of Gender Budget in India**\n\nGender Budget Statement (GBS) was first introduced in India Budget in 2005-2006. It comprises of two parts.\n\n* Part A reflects women specific schemes i.e., those which have 100% allocation for women.\n* Part B reflects Pro-women schemes i.e., those where at least 30% of allocation is for women.\n* India\u2019s Gender Budgeting efforts stand out globally because they have not only influenced expenditure but also revenue policies (like differential rates in property tax rates).\n* Gender Budgeting efforts in India have encompassed knowledge building and network; institutionalize the process, capacity building and chance capability.\n* Gender Budgeting Cells (GBC) as an institutional mechanism has been mandated to be set up in all Ministries/Departments. But there are only a few **\u2018big budget\u2019** women exclusives schemes of Ministry of Women and child Development like the **Nirbhaya Fund** and **Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao** campaign.\n\nEven though India has made significant strides in gender budgeting, it still leaves a lot to be achieved for real empowerment of women, towards which government should work earnestly.",

The necessity of PMJDY in financial inclusion is because of following reasons:\n\n* According to census report of 2011 out of total population only 58.7 percent population have access to banking services remaining 42%. PMJDY would bring in those who have been left behind by mainstreaming banking services and would reduce the role of money lenders.\n* Under this scheme people would get basic bank accounts with **insurance facility and an additional facility of overdraft**. Thus they would avail benefit offered by banks and facilities provided by government and will be able **to develop small savings habits, and which will enhance capital formation,** resulting in **increased economic development of country**.\n* Banks are now opening bank accounts **with zero balance** and providing facilities to poor and unbanked section of society so that they can also get maximum benefits from banking sector.\n* **Debit card facility** is also very helpful to poor people where they can withdraw money at any time and at any place.\n* Under PMJDY bank accounts can be opened **with a single document** (Easy KYC Norms), this will encourage uneducated customers who hesitate to go to banks just because of lengthy documentation process.\n\nThe PMJDY is playing its role in great manner by ensuring mass participation of people and providing them low cost financial services and banking facilities, still there is need to impart financial knowledge and awareness among people about benefits of banks and basic banking facilities. But just opening accounts would not fulfil the desired goals of financial inclusion because of idle banks accounts which only increase expenses of banks. Real benefits would go to people when people will use these accounts. Demonetisation helps in a great way in this direction.",

It is a city where information technology is the principle infrastructure and the basis for providing essential services to residents.\n\nIn recent times, the increasing burden on urban settlements raises concern related to sustainable development. To tackle these problems such as high urban poverty level, environmental degradation, inadequate basic services, relevance of Smart Cities has increased which provide smart solutions.\n\nE-Governance and Citizen Services: It will help in making citizen centric service delivery system, which will enhance the efficiency of public authorities.\n\nSmart Waste Management: Waste management is one of the major problems in urban settlement. Smart waste management like separation of solid waste at source level and use of eco-friendly waste disposal techniques, would avoid the problems like urban floods situation.\n\nSmart Health: Tele-medicine would reduce the pressure on medical facilities due to use of ICT in health facilities.\n\nMobility system: Smart transport is also one of the main features that address the core issue in urban settlement. Many other areas such as, education, communication, electricity, renewable energy would also be addressed by the Smart Cities.\n\nHigh development in urban cities and less emphasis on development in rural areas has increased the rural-urban difference because of lack of opportunities in rural areas. In such a scenerio **\u2018Smart villages\u2019** concept of **Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Rurban Mission** would focus on development of rural area from multi-directions.

FDI in an economy helps in relaxing the domestic savings constraints. It helps to overcome the foreign exchange barrier thereby increases capital flow and provides risk-sharing capital financing. It furnishes the funds needed for the full utilization of the existing production capacity.\n\nIt promotes efficiency and productivity through international competition of superior quality products. It provides access to the superior technology, superior managerial skills and bigger markets.\n\nA remarkable inflow of FDI in various industrial units in India will boost the economic life of our country. It can also ensure a number of employment opportunities by aiding the setting up of industrial units in various corners of India.\n\nAccording to the World Bank\u2019s Ease of doing Business Index, Indian Economy is less attractive because of infrastructural bottlenecks such as availability of electricity, dealing with construction permits; registering property; getting credit; protecting minority investors; paying taxes; trading across borders corruption, strict labour laws etc. Other than these reasons, difficult of exit policy, red tapism, bureaucratic inertia, political deadlock play great role in maintaining gap between MoUs signed and actual FDIs in Indian economy.\n\nLand acquisition for industry is contentious in India, particularly when the purchaser is foreign. Concerns about the control of natural resources by foreign companies have stymied efforts to liberalize foreign investment\n\nThe world's fourth-largest steelmaker by output POSCO signed a preliminary agreement to build the $5.3 billion facility, with capacity to produce 6 million tons a year. Posco dropped the project because of deteriorating market conditions and delays in securing mining rights.\n\nInsolvency and Bankruptcy Code, Ease of doing business, establishment of Special Economic Zone, Labour laws reforms can help in attracting FDIs in Indian economy.",

Its main objectives included:\n\n* Weakening the domination of landlords and providing security of tenure to share croppers and land to landless and poor peasants.\n* Simulating the growth of productivity and output in agriculture by eliminating feudal and semi-feudal land relations.\n* Expanding rural markets by means of a significant redistribution of productive assets, especially land, and by adequate public investment in the agrarian economy.\n\nIn the success of land reforms in India, following factor were responsible.\n\n1. **Political will:** Land reforms were more successful in some states such as West Bengal, Kerala because of strong political will of the government. Provisions of land reforms were implemented actively.\n2. The pro-poor impact of land reforms was enhanced by the emergence of the system of decentralized local government put in place by the Left Front in 1978 (West Bengal) soon after coming to office.\n3.

Crop insurance provides protection to farmers against losses caused by crop failure and thereby ensures stability in farm income.\n* It also reduces, to some extent, government expenditure incurred on relief measures extended to meet the havoc caused by natural calamities such as droughts and floods, locusts, plant diseases.\n* It also strengthens the position of co-operatives and other institutions that finance, agriculture to the extent it enables the farmer members to repay their loans in years of crop failure.\n* By protecting the economic interest of the farmers against possible risk or loss, it accelerates adoption of new agricultural practices.\n* It may act as anti-inflationary measure, by locking up part of the resources in rural areas.\n\nThe government launched a new crop insurance scheme, PM\u2019s Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) with a view to de-risk agriculture from the vagaries of nature. Salient features of PMFBY are following.\n\n* PMFBY targets to cover 50% India\u2019s cropped area in the next three years. There will be a uniform premium of only 2% to be paid by farmers for all Kharif crops and 1.5% for all Rabi crops.\n* In case of annual commercial and horticultural crops, the premium to be paid by farmers will be only 5%.\n* There is no upper limit on Government subsidy. Even if balance premium is 90%, it will be borne by the Government.\n* The new scheme will also seek to address a long-standing demand of farmers and provide farm-level assessment for localized calamities, including hailstorms, unseasonal rains, landslides and inundation.",

        "explanation": "India embarked on developing space science and technology in an era when it was being criticized for spending money on such expensive technologies when it\u2019s priority should be fighting rampant poverty that prevails.\n\nHowever, our visionary leaders like Nehru and scientists prevailed over such criticisms and led India onto a path of great technological achievements. It has shown its proverbs in the field through achievements like **Mars Orbiter Mission** at a cost ten times lower than US\u2019s similar project, **Chandrayan mission** which made ISRO sixth space organization to send orbiter to moon, developing it\u2019s own navigation system through **NAVIC (IRNSS)**. Thus ending its dependence on GPS. It has also made major strides in launch vehicles by developing **Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV),** GSLV with indigenous cryogenic stage which made India self reliant in launching 2 ton class communication satellites, record launch of 20 satellites in 2016 etc.\n\nApart from being a mighty achievement, these achievements have also helped in socio-economic developments of the country. Through metrological data sent by satellites, it has been possible to gauge weather changes, arrival of monsoon and extent of rainfall, monitoring cyclones in advance which has helped farmers and citizens through advanced preparedness in general and in events of disasters. The communication satellites have enabled data connectivity to rural India eventually helped in digital India. NAVIC has made India self reliant thus saving resources, ensuring reliable data for army, farmers, tourists, navigators, fishermen.",

        "explanation": "In the recent years nanotechnology has revolu-tionized scientific research across the globe in a big way. Today, from agriculture to aerospace research, nanotechnology's impact is being felt. Research in nanotechnology spans across an array of fields such as health, environment, agriculture, food and beverages, product development, space technology, power generation, genetics, biotechnology, forensic science, electronics and communications.\n\nAt a commercial level the impact of nanotechnology is on three major industries, namely consumer products, electronics and healthcare. Some applications that make nanotechnology one of the key technologies in 21st century are discussed below:\n\n* Nanosilver provides an effective, broad-spectrum antimicrobial coating to the surface of various consumer products. Therefore silver nanotechnology is being used in a wide range of consumer products such as wound dressings, textiles, food storage containers, paints and personal care appliances.\n* Nanotechnology has significantly scaled down the size of transistors and chips used in the production of computers and other electronic goods.\n* Nanotechnology has made great strides in the field of medicine. Several nano- sized gadgets and materials are being developed to diagnose and treat diseases like cancer more effectively. Nano-pharmacology helps to produce smart drugs that have negligible side effects.\n* Nanoscale thin films on eyeglasses, computer and camera displays, windows, and other surfaces can make them water-repellent, antireflective, self-cleaning, resistant to ultraviolet or infrared light, antifog, antimicrobial, scratch-resistant, or electrically conductive.\n* Scientists are coating fabrics with a thin layer of zinc oxide nanoparticles that give better protection from UV radiation.\n* Using nanoparticles in the manufacture of solar cells is beneficial as they can reduce manufacturing costs by using a low temperature process.",

        "explanation": "Rehabilitation and Resettlement is one of the major challenges while planning the major developmental projects. To tackle this, Government has adopted National Rehabilitation and Resettlement policy to minimize displacement.\n\n* Its objectives are to promote as far as possible non-displacing or least-displacing alternatives, to ensure adequate rehabilitation package and expeditious implementation of the rehabilitation process with the active participation of affected families.\n* The right to fair compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Bill, 2015 also addresses the issue such as if private company acquires or purchase more than 50 acres of land in urban areas or 100 acres in rural areas it is required to rehabilitate and resettle affected families. This threshold can be circumvented by a private company by purchasing multiple parcels of land, each under the prescribed limit, through other entities.\n* The Singur judgement by the Apex court centered around the inept and illegitimate handling of power of Eminent Domain by the then Government. The Court said that it should not be left unacknowledged that when Eminent Domain is exercised the displaced persons is not provided with anything but cash compensation.\n* The Morse and Berger 1992 Report said that of the total displaced in the case of Sardar Sarovar dam project 58% were adivasis. These people did not possess formal title to their land and therefore could not claim compensation anyway.\n* Apart from all these measures, education facilities, health facilities should be taken care of displaced families should be resettled in groups that would protect their cultural and traditional rights.",

        "explanation": "Flooding and disruption have become the new normal for the monsoon season in urban India. Recent water logging in Gurgaon, urban flood in Mumbai and Srinagar shows the increasing intensity of urban flood disasters in India. These are some of the reasons of urban floods in case of Indian cities.\n\n* A special feature in India is heavy rainfall during monsoons. There are other weather systems also that bring in a lot of rain. Storm surges can also affect coastal cities/ towns.\n* The urban heat island effect has resulted in an increase in rainfall over urban areas. Global climate change is resulting in changed weather patterns and increased episodes of high intensity rainfall events occurring in shorter periods of time.\n* Stormwater drainage systems in the past were designed for rainfall intensity of 12\u201320 mm. These capacities get easily overwhelmed whenever rainfall of higher intensity is experienced. Further, the systems very often do not work to the designed capacities because of very poor maintenance.\n* Encroachments are also a major problem in many cities and towns. The flow of water has increased in proportion to the urbanization of the watersheds. Ideally, the natural drains should have been widened (similar to road widening for increased traffic) to accommodate the higher flows of stormwater. But on the contrary, there have been large scale encroachments on the natural drains and the river flood plains. Consequently the capacity of the natural drains has decreased, resulting in flooding.\n* Improper disposal of solid waste, including domestic, commercial and industrial waste and dumping of construction debris into the drains also contributes significantly to reducing drainage capacities.\n* Presence of impervious cover near trees and on road pavements also reduces water runoff.\n\nTo reduce these risk following measure can be taken:\n\n* Pre-Monsoon Desilting of drainage system.\n* Solid waste disposal and its proper management has significant effect on drainage performance and reduces the chances of choking of drainage system.\n* Protection and conservation of wetlands near urban habitats increase the water holding capacities and they also act as natural barriers against any surge in water level.\n* Rain water harvesting reduces the load of excess rain water of rain and help in mitigating urban floods.",

        "explanation": "Cloudburst is a short-term extreme precipitation of 10 cm or above rainfall in an hour which occurs over a small area.\n\nWhen saturated clouds are unable to produce rain because of the upward movement of warm current of air leading to excessive condensation, raindrops are carried upwards by the air current instead of dropping as rainfall. After a point raindrops become too heavy to be carried upwards and drop together in a quick flash. This phenomenon is known as cloudbursts.\n\nRainfall does not directly cause death but the consequences of the cloudbursts in the form of rainfall triggers landslides, flash floods, houses and establishment getting swept and cave in lead to death and damage. Restoring settlements near mountain foothills is difficult due to flashfloods that might happen from cloudburst.\n\n**Ways to minimise the loss of life and property**\n\nDetecting cloud bursts is a difficult task as it covers small areas so precaution will go a long way in lessening the damage.\n\n* Stopping haphazard construction in hilly areas.\n* Preventing encroachments of riverbeds.\n* Afforestation programmes specially on hill slopes to prevent landslides.\n* Alert-relay system (Early warning system) should be put in place so that people can evacuate on time.\n\nThe damaged ground must be replanted as soon as possible since erosion caused by loss of ground soil cover can lead to flash flooding and additional landslides in the near future.\n\nSpace Application Centre (SAC) of ISRO has developed a model for heavy rainfall/cloud burst alert to prevent the damage caused by a cloudburst. It is currently working on pilot basis but once its effectiveness is proven, it will go a long way in saving lives.",

This act would also counter India\u2019s image of being a soft state.\n* Russia has also backed India, saying Pakistan should take effective steps in order to stop activities of terrorist groups in its territory. India seems to have played its cards well by seeking international and regional isolation of Pakistan before striking infiltrator targets across the LOC.\n\nThere are also several negative impacts of these types of acts as it may escalate the conflict especially in case of Pakistan, Security forces can be trapped in enemy territory.

        "explanation": "In recent years, with the emergence of new terrorist organizations like ISIS, Boko Haram etc. terrorism has become a competitive industry. Like mafia organizations, where one-upmanship is often based on who has the most guns, money or local power, terrorist groups too have a pecking order.\n\nThe current competitive market in terrorism means that groups are trying to distinguish each other through the practice of more memorable violence (like the Charlie Hebdo attacks or the Peshawar attacks in December 2014). They need to do so because this is the only way in which they can be heard, become popular enough to attract recruits and distinguish themselves from other similar groups. In order to do so the terrorist groups are trying to out-do each other in the intensity and scope of violence and bloodshed they can cause so that more people can identify with them and join them. For example- while some years back, Al-Qaeda was the most dreaded terrorist group of the world, this position has now been overtaken by ISIS. One of the reasons for this can be because ISIS encourages lone-wolf attacks which are easier for its followers to carry out without actually travelling to join the group to fight in combat.\n\nVarious terrorist organizations are also in competition with each other to get control of various natural resources such as oil reserves in Middle East countries, cultivation of Opium, arms dealing etc.\n\nCompetition over establishing their ideologies all around the world has also instigated terrorist organization for example multiple groups are fighting with each other in Syria. So in recent time terrorism has become a competitive industry that has spread its influence all over the world.",
