        "explanation": "India has a vast basket of diverse art and cultural heritage which need institutional support and encouragement to address areas critical for their survival and preservation.\n\nWe need to preserve our art heritage because of the following reasons.\n\n* Presently, many Indian art forms are on the verge of extinction such as Manjusha painting of Bihar, traditional art of Puppetry, Parsi embroidery, Naga craft, Dhokra handicraft, etc., which need protection and preservation.\n* India has a unique identity in the world for its art and culture which represents Indian civilization on world platform and if it vanishes the uniqueness of India will get affected.\n* For many tribal communities, art and craft is the source of income.\n* This is also the source of attraction for tourism which contributes to economic development of the country.\n* Art heritage also represents \u201cunity in diversity\u201d of India and builds a bridge between people living abroad to get connected with their native country.\n* Art and culture is also a part of soft power in world politics.\n\nGovernment has started many initiatives to preserve the rich art heritage of the country, such as, Scheme for Conservation of Wall Painting (1996-97), Ek Bharat Shresth Bharat programe, Tribal haats, GI tag to the local products, e-haat, etc. Apart from strict implementation of such programmes, Government should provide financial assistance to strengthen regional and local museums, preserve art heritage through virtual media, and promote local paintings on products like wallet, mobile cover, pillow cover, etc.",

        "explanation": "Reconstruction of Indian history of the ancient and medieval era is a daunting task owing to lack of chronological records, and subjectivity in the interpretation of archaeological and literary sources.\n\nIn this context, accounts of foreign travellers, who were eye witnesses to the events that occurred at that time, become an important source to corroborate other sources of history.\n\n**Chinese Accounts**\n\nAccounts of Fa-hien, Hsuan Tsang, and I-tsing have proved to be a valuable source of information on the Gupta period and the years following the end of Gupta rule. They provided vital information about:\n\n* **Socio-economic conditions in India -** For example, Fa-hien mentions about the Chandalas (untouchables) living outside the village. This shows that untouchablility was prevalent in the society as early as 5th Century AD.\n* **Existing political conditions -** For example, Hsuan Tsang\u2019s account shows that during Harsha\u2019s reign (7th Century AD), Pataliputra was in a state of decline and on the other hand, Prayag and Kannauj in the doab had emerged important.\n* **Nature of Buddhist doctrines, rituals, and monastic institutions in India -** For example - Hsuan Tsang and I-tsing provided vivid accounts of Nalanda.\n\n**Arab Accounts**\n\n* Arab travellers such as the merchants - Sulayman, Abu Zaid, etc. provided vivid accounts on Indian culture and science, which are valuable sources for the study of early medieval Indian history.\n* Abu Zaid noted that most Indian princes while holding court, allowed their women to be seen unveiled \u2013 highlighting that there was no system of purdah (veiling) in upper class women in early medieval India.\n* Arab travellers also provide information about the socio-economic condition through their description of trade contacts and the wealth which was exclusively derived from the trade with India.\n* Arab travellers of the period like Al-Beruni and Ibn Battuta had direct personal contacts with the people of Indian subcontinent which enabled them to give detailed first hand information in their accounts about the economic, social and other activities of the people.\n\nThough there are issues associated with the reliability of the accounts provided by these travellers owing to their personal biases, still they are key sources for finding out the missing links in the reconstruction of Indian history.",

Gandhian ideal of social consciousness to eliminate it needs to be taken forward. |\n| Women Emancipation | With glass-ceiling still far from being shattered in the public sphere, the Gandhian thought of women emancipation continues to hold relevance. |\n\nGandhian thoughts about compassion, punctuality and sanitation are the other ideals that continue to hold value in our times marked by strife, procrastination in public and private lives and casual attitude towards hygiene.\n\nUltimately, all ideals and thoughts of the Mahatma were reached by him via a process of life long experimentation with truths and this makes Gandhian thoughts most significant in what is also being called by a few as post-truth era.",

Also, this will help solidify India\u2019s position as a regional power as NavIC will be open for use by India\u2019s neighbours as well.\n\nFurther, it will help meet local user requirements of the positioning, navigation and timing services.\n\n**Navigation**\n\n* IRNSS will provide two types of navigation services:\n  + Standard Positioning Service \u2013 for all users.\n  + Restricted Service \u2013 an encrypted service only for authourised users.\n* The signals broadcast by IRNSS satellites will transmit navigation service signals (timing and position information) to the users.\n* This data will be used to give users visual and voice navigation assistance.\n* These will form the basis for variety of navigation applications:\n  + Land navigation \u2013 traffic management, tracking train\u2019s movement, land survey, etc.\n  + Marine navigation \u2013 fishermen, merchant ships, port operations, disaster management, etc.\n  + Aerial navigation \u2013 civil aviation, military operations, etc.",

Pursuant to this, in 2013, India gained Observer status in the Arctic Council.\n\n* **Potential Natural Resources:** Arctic region holds oil and natural gas resources which can boost India\u2019s energy security and diversify its energy imports especially when West Asia is under geopolitical turmoil. Arctic is also an abundant source for fishing.\n* **Potential for Newer Shipping Routes:** As global climate warms up and polar ice recedes, new paths between Asia, Europe and North America become open which can reduce cost of transportation for India\u2019s exports and imports. For example, the Northern Sea Route, a mostly frozen seaway can become navigable throughout the year.\n* **Increased Vulnerability of Coastal Communities:** Melting of ice on large scale can make India\u2019s coastal cities more vulnerable to sea level rise.\n* **Potential for Joint Research on Environmental Issues:** Joint research with countries like Norway can help India in better research on issues related to aerosol radiation, space weather, glacier cycles which are also mandate of Himadri Research Station.\n* **Geopolitical Importance:** While a treaty for Arctic, a global common, being negotiated, it is a strategic necessity to mould it in India\u2019s favour.

        "language": "en"
      },
      "solution": {
        "explanation": "Mantle plume is an upwelling of abnormally hot rock within the earth's mantle which carries heat upward in narrow, rising columns, driven by heat exchange across the core-mantle boundary. Eventually, the rising column of hot rock reaches the base of the lithosphere, where it spreads out, forming a mushroom-shaped cap to the plume. Heat transferred from the plume raises the temperature in the lower lithosphere to above melting point, and forms magma chambers that feed volcanoes at the surface. It is a secondary way through which earth loses heat. In 1971, geophysicist W. Jason Morgan developed the hypothesis of mantle plumes.\n\n**Role of Mantle Plumes in Plate Tectonics**\n\n* Mantle plumes transport primordial mantle material from below the zone of active convection; produce time-progressive volcanic chains; break up continents; and act as a driving force for plate tectonics.\n* The narrow conduits of deep-mantle material rise through the solid mantle before spreading out laterally in the upper asthenosphere. From there, they cause the lithosphere to swell and shear as the heat from the plume increases the temperature of lower lithosphere.\n* Mantle plumes are also thought to be the cause of volcanic centers known as hotspots and probably have also caused flood basalts.\n* As the plume remains anchored at the core-mantle boundary and it does not shift position over time, a string of volcanoes is created when the lithospheric plate moves above it. The formation of the Hawaiian Island and Emperor Seamount chain in the middle of the Pacific Plate are caused by mantle plume.",

      "solution": {
        "explanation": "\"Dead Zone\" is a more common term for hypoxia, which refers to a reduced level of oxygen in the water in some parts of the world's oceans and large lakes. In March 2004, Global Environment Outlook Year Book, published by the UN Environment Programme, reported 146 dead zones in the world's oceans. One of the largest dead zones forms in the Gulf of Mexico every spring. Hypoxic zones can occur naturally but climate change, nutrients run-off from the land, and eutrophication are leading to algal bloom and causing further depletion of oxygen level in water. As a result dead zones are spreading at much faster pace.\n\n**Consequences of spreading dead zones on marine ecosystem:**\n\n* The reduced dissolved oxygen in ocean water results in loss of marine life thus the habitats which were teeming with life become biological desert.\n* Toxic algal blooms release toxins that can poison fish, molluscs and marine mammals like dolphins. Thus, affecting marine ecosystem by altering its food chain.\n* The reproductive problems emanate when the oxygen level depletes i.e. there is lower egg count and less spawning.\n* Slow moving bottom-dwelling creatures like clams, lobsters and oysters are unable to escape the dead zone and face extinction.\n* When fast moving marine species flee from the dead zones and occupy a new habitat, they cause overcrowding of their new habitats and affect the ecosystem services over there.\n\nIt is clear that the spread of dead zones can affect most marine ecosystems and have socio-economic ramifications due to human dependency on marine goods and services.",

      "solution": {
        "explanation": "**Introduction**\n\n* Caste refers to a broad hierarchical institutional arrangement along which basic social factors like birth, marriage, food-sharing etc are arranged in a hierarchy of rank and status. These sub-divisions are traditionally linked to occupations and decide the social relations with respect to other upper and lower castes.\n* The traditional hierarchical ordering of castes was based on the distinction between \u2018purity\u2019 and \u2018pollution\u2019. While the manifestation of the order has changed to a large extent in the recent times, the system itself has not changed much.\n  + For example- even though untouchability and caste-based discrimination is barred under the Constitution of India, occupations like manual scavenging have the majority of workers from lower castes.\n\n**New identities and associational forms**\n\n* **Political:**In contrast to the older structure, various caste communities have asserted themselves by forming political parties based on caste identities. For example-\n  + Bahujan Samaj Party. Political mobilization based on caste has been rising.\n  + Lingayats\u2019 demand to be considered as a minority community.\n* **Economic:**Development policies targeting the backward castes and scheduled have benefitted only a section of the population. These sections have emerged as the elite and this has created a division within the backward castes. Also, the welfare policies have led to social stigma among the castes which are not included. These policies have strengthened the caste-based mobilization. For example:\n  + Dominant castes like Marathas,\u00a0kapus\u00a0and\u00a0patidars\u00a0have been demanding reservation.\n  + Socially empowered and landholding communities like Jats have also mobilized themselves and have demanded reservation.\n* **Social:**Under the impact of globalization and technological advancement, the strict codes of marriage and inheritance have diluted with more inter-caste marriages taking place. Caste groups like Khap Panchayats have been brought under the scrutiny of the judiciary. The expression of social exclusion and maintaining the caste-based division by the communities has however not vanished but has changed to become more subtle. For example-\n  + The matrimonial advertisements are frequent in the newspapers that especially demand brides and grooms from particular communities.\n  + Even religions that do not follow caste systems like Muslims and Christianity have observed caste-like discrimination. Dalits who have converted to Christianity have separate graveyards in States like Kerala.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n* Considering that these divisions offer solidarity and psychological strength to various marginalized groups, even if the caste-based discrimination is diffused through the legislative enforcement the divisions of identity will be difficult to erase.",

Since then a large number of programmes and schemes have been launched, but they have not been able to give the desired results. Reasons for existence of poverty in India are:\n\n* Numerous already functional poverty alleviation programmes work in silos.\n* There is no systematic attempt to identify people who are below poverty line; to determine and address their needs; and enable them to move above the poverty line.\n* There are cases of corruption in identification of beneficiaries, and there is also a lack of authentic data at every level.\n* A typically low administrative capacity, coupled with problems of implementation at State level has often resulted in the under utilization of funds.\n* Leakage at different levels has led to diversion of resources meant for deprived ones.\n* These programmes have focused on top to bottom approach, but such approach lacks coordination in decision making and causes clogging of funds and asymmetry in distribution.\n\nPoverty eradication in a country with a huge population like India needs to involve programmes and policies with bottom up approach, technological interventions, and a mix of innovative ideas like Universal Basic Income.",

It means that the spheres of secularism and religion are distinct, independent, exclusive and separate without overlapping zones.\n\nThe Indian concept of secularism differs from western model of secularism as secularism emerged in the Western Europe as an opposite ideology to the church hegemony and as a protest against the wars and massacres in the name of religion. Secularism thus originated as an anti-religious principle. On the other hand, the Indian concept of secularism is not a rejection of religious practices. In Indian context, secularism means equal respect for all faiths and the state keeping itself impartial in not preferring one religion over other.\n\nSecularism in India does not stand for the abolition of religion, unlike in the West, but only for the separation of state from religion. While accepting the identities of various religious groups and their freedom to propagate, the Indian concept of secularism limits all those practices to the private life and negates every idea of mixing religion in the public life.\n\nThe uniqueness of Indian secularism is that it admits the freedom of religion, unlike its western counterpart that avoids religion. This religious freedom granted in the secular concept, makes the consolidation of religious people under one umbrella a reality in India.",

        "explanation": "Indian social set-up during the medieval period was based on Brahmanism characterized by rigid caste division, rituals and methods of prayer. Bhakti Movement was a reformative movement characterized by intense devotion or love for God. The movement focused to reform Indian society which was shadowed by Brahmanical dominance.\n\nBhakti Movement started from South India in the form of Vaishnavite and Shaivaite sect, commonly known as Alvars and Nayanars respectively. Early 16th century was marked by rise of Bhakti Saint Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu in Eastern India. He was a Vaishanavit Saint and an ardent follower of Lord Krishna. According to his followers, he was an incarnation of Lord Krishna.\n\nChaitnaya Mahaprabhu preached love, compassion, and non-violence. Though he was a Brahmin, he condemned caste system and emphasized on equality for all. According to him true worship lay in love and devotion. Bhakti Movement is known to transcend the practice of strict rituals and religious practices. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is known to have revolutionized and re-oriented Bhakti Movement, giving it impetus through simplicity in teachings, propagating Bhakti ideas through his disciples, instructing them to write books, and overall making it a mass movement\n\nThe very first mandate by Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu to his disciples was to go to each house and ask people to chant \u2018Hari Bol\u2019. By this, he propagated amongst people the practice of \u2018Nama Simaran\u2019 as a mode of devotion and love for God. Further, he propagated his message of \u2018Hari Bol\u2019 through \u2018Sankirtan Mandali\u2019. In these Mandalies, devotees used to chant, sing and dance. Through Sankirtan, chanting of Hari Bol and combined dance and chant, Mahaprabhu brought people from different caste, creed, religion and sex together.\n\nThe message of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu or Gaudiya School of thought is now propagated through ISKCON Movement across the world. It has participation of devotees from around the world. In other words it can be said that Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu not only revolutionized Bhakti movement but also universalized it.",

Creation of new states offer possibilities of having better governance structure, greater participation for people, administrative convenience for the State and equitable distribution of resources. Regional development strengthens the equitable and symmetric growth of India.\n\n**Benefits from the Creation of New States:**\n\n* The Economic Survey 2016-17 stated that smaller states in India trade more than the rest. Smaller states offer better and efficient administration which leads to creation of infrastructure strengthening the connectivity in the area, expand its access to market and boost trade for the overall economy of the country.\n* People of the region gain control over its resources and an organic model of growth can emerge to address their economic aspirations.\n* Political stability that arises from better representation of people creates conducive environment for investment in the region. Thereby encouraging regional economic development.\n* The new states can have political freedom to frame legislations that address the unique and specific economic problems of the region affected by its geographical location, sociological conditions, technological advancement, availability of human capital etc. Factors that can hinder the economic growth following the creation of new states:\n* New states may find itself lacking in infrastructure (administrative and industrial), which requires time, money and effort to build. As was observed in the creation of Telangana from Andhra Pradesh.\n* The stabilization of the government and administrative institutions requires time for resolution of various issues such as division of assets, funds and of the state civil services. Also the creation of sustainable linkage from the other parts to the newly formed state\u2019s capital can take time affecting the overall economic stability of the country.\n* Territorial issues, disputes over water sharing (eg Krishna water dispute between Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra), disagreements over capital (as observed in the case of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana over Hyderabad) are some other issues that can hinder the economic progress of these States and the country.\n* Mere creation of newer states out of the existing ones cannot guarantee faster and inclusive economic development in the region. The economic benefits from the creation of new states can only be reaped if it is followed by establishment of good governance, sustained socio-political stability and better coordination with the rest of the country.",

Thus, British exploited both the vulnerability and readily available large population.\n\nOnce placed in British colonies, festivals such as Muharram, Holi served as a placental link to preserve their cultural Identity.\n\n* In Trinidad, the annual Muharram procession was transformed in to carnival \u2018Hosay\u2019 for Imam Hossain drawing a large crowd.\n* The protest religion of RASTAFARIANISM popularized by Bob Marley reflects social and cultural links with Indian migrants to Carribean.\n* Chutney music became popular in Trinidad.\n* Bollywood kept alive the cultural identity among indentured labor.\n* A rigid caste system of Indian society melted as indentured people identified more with \u2018Indianness\u2019, promoting fraternal feeling.\n* Initiatives such as \u2019Know India Programme\u2019 are conscious efforts by Government of India to ensure a continuum of new generations with Indian ethos.\n\nHowever, the Sri Lankan 13th Amendment to constitution is reminder that the quest to preserve their culture continues in some places. By and large, indentured labour have been able to retain their cultural heritage and renew their links with India both as potent act of resistance and a powerful affirmation of their distinctness.",

        "explanation": "The NITI Aayog in its recently released **Composite Water Management Index** warned that India is facing its \u2018worst\u2019 water crisis in history. Critical groundwater resources, which accounted for 40% of India\u2019s water supply, are being depleted at \u201cunsustainable\u201d rates.Twenty-one cities, including Delhi, Bengaluru, Chennai and Hyderabad will run out of groundwater by 2020, affecting 100 million people.\n\nThough there are many ways to check the further depletion of ground water and increase the level of water such as limit of water-extraction, change in crop-patterns, diverting river streams, building reservoirs and plantation drives but water harvesting system provides ideal solution for the problem.\n\nWater Harvesting (WH) means capturing rain water, where it falls and capture the runoff from, catchment and streams etc. Local people can easily be trained to build expand systems themselves. It will not only reduce water bills; provide an alternative supply during water restrictions but also ensure supply of high quality water - pure, free of chemicals. In fact, depending upon tank size and climate, rainwater harvesting can reduce main water use by 100%. RWH also decreases storm water runoff, thereby helping to reduce local flooding and scouring of creeks. RWH is most suitable where groundwater is scarce, contaminated, rugged or mountainous terrains, risk to aquifer from salt water intrusion.\n\n**Approaches for Effectiveness of WH in Urban India**\n\n* Water Harvesting in urban small areas is done by surface runoff harvesting and rooftop rainwater harvesting. Since present day urbanization has resulted both in shrinking of open spaces and very minimal area remaining unpaved, so small structures like recharge pit, recharge trenches, dug wells, recharge shafts, and percolation tanks should be built to capture the runoff and inject rainwater into the soil during rains.\n* For better effectiveness of water harvesting in urban areas, existing water bodies should be protected and revived without allowing any further construction in them in future. This will have to be undertaken by the government. At the micro level every resident/individual should implement both rooftop and driveway runoff harvesting in their respective homes, commercial complexes, office premises, factories etc.\n\nMost metro cities in India are water starved but not rain starved. We should not forget the fact that water harvested is water produced and make sincere attempts to harvest every drop of water that falls within every premises, locality, city and country. For this, WH should be made mandatory in new buildings.",

The economic and financial feasibility of ICs should be ensured by attracting potential investors to set up manufacturing units at National Investment and Manufacturing Zones (NMIZs). India will also have to rely on foreign players for innovative technologies. The fundamental focus of ICs should be on improving both Industrial and Urban Infrastructure.",

        "explanation": "Though efforts were made to uplift the status of women prior to independence, the women\u2019s movement in India gained prominence in 1970s and 80s. These movements have tried to bring the women specific issues in the public domain.\n\nHowever, it is found that these have not been able to address the issues of the women of lower social strata, belonging to SC, ST, minorities, and BPL families.\n\n* It is being seen that activists within the movements are urban, western, and middle class. Therefore, the movement is being considered a Western product. It has little to do with the lives of thousands of poor, rural, underprivileged women all over India.\n* Women continue to have unequal access to land and other resources. Compensation policies in case of displacement are inevitably discriminatory towards women of lower strata due to multiple reasons such as lack of awareness, education etc. Women from these sections also find it more difficult to get loans.\n* Recently, several movements have raised the gender issues through temple entry movement, triple talaq, etc. But temple entry movements are restricted to the specified places only, and triple talaq especially in hinterland or rural areas, go unnoticed.\n* Sexual and domestic violence is mainly perpetrated against the women from lower caste and poor women but this issue has not acquired centre-stage in the discourse of women movements.\n\nIssues of women agricultural labourers (e.g. fair wages etc.), women domestic workers and women manual scavengers has not been raised by the women movement prominently.\n\nHowever, there is also a counter view that the urban, middle-class women are one of the participants in the movement. It is rather the poor women which are the backbone of the movements, exemplified the presence of poor women in the anti-alcohol agitation in Andhra Pradesh, and other parts of India. Similarly, the movement to protect the environment was started by poor women in Reni village of Uttarakhand and thereafter, it spread to other parts of the country.\n\nBut there are substantial evidences to prove that women movements have neglected the lower strata women. The National Federation of Dalit Women (NFDW), formed in 1995, has forced women\u2019s movements in India to address the caste question seriously. Thus there is an urgent need of women movements to be more inclusive and just, embracing the cause of poor and vulnerable women.",

The pace of globalization has accelerated in India after the adoption of the policies of liberalization, privatization & globalization in the 1990s.\n\nGlobalization is leaving its footprints on almost every aspect of Indian society such as language (English), cuisine, clothing, etc., and thus leading to homogenization in many respects. There is an increasing tendency towards \u2018glocalisation\u2019 of culture which refers to the mixing of the global with the local culture.\n\nLiberal ideas of individualism are permeating the Indian society; joint families are giving way to nuclear families; live-in relationships are proliferating; celebration of Valentine\u2019s Day, Mother\u2019s Day; consumption of pizza, burger, chowmein etc.; wearing jeans and tops; cropping up of MNCs; popularity of Hollywood movies, Bhangra pop, Indi pop, etc. are some of the homogenizing influences of globalization on Indian society.\n\nHowever, globalization is not simply about homogenization, but it is also strengthening cultural specifities in India.\n\n* A large segment of populace feels insecure by the inroads of globalization and are trying to preserve their cultural traditions and practices.\n* Indian classical dance and music has got fillip in the recent years with the efforts of organization like SPIC MACAY and others.\n* Local customs, and festivals are being observed by some tribal groups, especially in North-east India more zealously than before.\n* The Indian culture has also spread its impact globally. Yoga traditions and practices are not only being practiced by Indians, but people across the globe are embracing them.\n* Indian system of Ayurveda is being promoted by a large section of society in the backdrop of the ills of western system of medicine and cure. For example profuse use of \u2018Patanjali\u2019 products by the middle and lower middle classes of India.\n\nHowever, there are also negative reactions to the process of globalization.

Its fundamental causes are secular like competition for share in political power or government jobs and a feeling of relative deprivation. Religion is not its fundamental cause but becomes an instrumental cause because it has great mobilizing power.\n\n**Example \u2013 The Bhiwandi communal riot (1970)**\n\nThe struggle for political power and a sense of relative deprivation creates communal problems. Bhiwandi in Maharashtra was a centre of powerloom industry with minority community\u2019s domination in ownership and labourers. Some members of minority community having amassed much wealth wanted to get a hold in the political set up of Bhiwandi, challenging the traditional leadership in Municipal administration. This led to a major riot in 1970.\n\nThe practice of mixing up religion with politics or using religion for the sake of political and economic gains is a reason for conflict between communities.\n\nThe progress of one community is viewed with unpleasantness and the economic collapse of the opposite side is gladly welcomed in a communally charged atmosphere. The vested interest groups having economic and other anti-social motives trigger communal conflicts in order to gain through a riot.\n\nReligion, when deliberately used as a tool for attaining power, both political and over resources, leads to the growth of communalism. The rising trend of communalism and the violent aftermath that follows it is a major threat to the integrity of India. So, efficient and effective measures must be adopted against the evil of communalism and checking its spread on the social fabric of India.",
