        "explanation": "The \u2018care economy\u2019 and \u2018monetized economy\u2019 deal with nature and value of the work and are two different aspects of economic activities.\n\nCare economy refers to the unpaid or underpaid work related to caregiving and providing social support, often performed within households. For example, childcare, eldercare, domestic work etc. Inter alia, it also involves paid labour encompassing nurses, caregivers, etc. (often females). The compensation is generally absent or very meagre compensation is awarded for such activities. It is highly undervalued even though it supports human development and social cohesion.\n\nMonetized economy includes all economic activities that are dealt with in terms of monetary value, which includes production of goods, e.g., finance, trade, etc. It is mainly aimed at profit generation. The compensation is received in terms of monetary value. Work done and goods produced in the economy are compensated in terms of wages, salaries, etc. It is assessed by its contribution to GDP and is often used as a measure of economic growth.\n\n**Ways to integrate care economy into monetized economy through women empowerment**\n\n* Social protection measures are required that provide income security for women in caregiving roles. For example, pension insurance for women engaged in such roles.\n* Development of skills for better transformation and incorporation of women into formal sector should be emphasized.\n* Supportive government policies should be there to promote gender-neutral reforms and collaboration between government and civil society organizations in care giving economy.\n  + For example, National Creche Scheme for the Children of Working Mothers, enhancing of maternity benefits, etc.\n* Technological solutions for care sector that reduces time and frees up women for formal sector employment can be considered.\n\nIntegration of care economy into monetized economy will not only enhance economic opportunities for women but also contribute to a more inclusive and equitable society.",

India joined the United States, Russia, and China to become the 4th nation to land on the moon.\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 comprised the Vikram Lander and Pragyaan Rover. The rover aims to move around the landing site conducting experiments and sending data to the lander which in turn will send data to the orbiter that will eventually be communicated back to the earth. The Chandrayaan-3 could become a game-changer because the \u2018permanently shadowed regions\u2019 near the South Pole may contain potential water-ice and resources. For this, the various subsystems onboard Chandrayaan-3 seek to undertake several experiments.\n\n**Lander payloads**\n\n* **Chandra\u2019s Surface Thermophysical Experiment (ChaSTE):** It measures thermal conductivity and temperature.\n* **Instrument for Lunar Seismic Activity (ILSA):** It measures the seismic frequencies around the landing site.\n* **Langmuir Probe (LP):** It estimates the plasma density and its changes over time.\n\n**Rover payloads**\n\n* **Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS)**: It determines elemental composition of lunar soil and rocks.\n* **Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscope (LIBS)**: It derives chemical composition and infers mineralogical composition of lunar surface.\n\n**Propulsion module payload**\n\n* **Spectro-polarimetry of HAbitable Planet Earth (SHAPE)**: It aims to study exo-planets for habitability.\n\n**Role of Virtual Launch Control Centre**\n\n* **Nerve centre of the operation:** All procedures and operations of the launch and the mission are controlled from this place.\n* **Master control:** In case of any abnormalities, safety protocols or the final abortion of the mission can be initiated from here.\n\nWith the success of Chandrayaan-3, India can now look forward to the sample retrieval from the moon surface under Chandrayaan-4 mission that will help deepen our understanding of the lunar surface.

It will be threatened if the coasts start submerging in ocean.\n  + **Costal Wetland Degradation:** Wetlands near coastal zones have a threat of degradation and even extinction.\n  + **Coral Bleaching:** Fresh water dilution resulting from an increased sea surface level is bound to cause coral bleaching.\n  + **Fauna Displacement:** Animals and biodiversity gets displaced from their environment which causes distress.\n  + **Groundwater Salination:** The water table gets contaminated by the incoming saltwater from the ocean, therefore reducing availability of usable groundwater.\n* **Economic impact:**\n  + **Property and Resource:** Damage to the property and resource due to increased occurrence of costal disasters will incur a high cost for the nation.\n  + **Loss of Livelihood:** Employment in costal based professions will take a hit as the people would have to relocate due to lack of livelihood options. Employment patterns will also change.\n* **Social impact:**\n  + **Displacement of People:** Climate refugees are a group of people that have been displaced by the horrors of climate change. The number of people losing their houses to the impact of climate change is rising every year.\n  + **Stress on Inland Location**: People displaced by the changes on the coastal areas are bound to move towards inland locations thereby putting pressure on already stressed resources.\n\n### Measures\n\n* Activities such as mangrove plantation can help in mitigating the problems of rising sea surface.\n* Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Rules and Integrated Coastal Zone Management Plan seek to regulate the management and resource utilization in coastal areas.\n\nVarious other researches predict an even early onset of these effects with much more devastating consequences.

For example, Nagaland separatism, Kashmiri separatism etc.\n* **Communalism:** The contentions between the two major religious groups have often led to brewing of hatred and fights. This further fuels separatist tendencies. Hate among groups makes our citizens easy targets to be motivated for terrorist activities.\n* **Illegal Migration:** Over the years, illegal migration has led to a lot of associated problems such as demographic change and increased unemployment thereby straining the nation\u2019s resources.\n* **Left-Wing Extremism:** It is noticed in the central and eastern parts of India and is marked by Marxism or Maoism as its political ideology. Socio-economic disparities and land alienation are the factors responsible for its emergence.\n\nVarious intelligence and investigative agencies work in India with different mandates of performing actions.\n\n* **National Investigation Agency (NIA):** It is the premier counter-terrorism law enforcement agency of India, investigating offences that affect the sovereignty, security and integrity of India.\n* **Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB):** It is the apex body to coordinate between various narcotics and drug law enforcement agencies. It works to prevent drug trafficking across India.\n* **Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI):** This is the body dealing with intelligence of smuggling of contrabands and investigating cases related to it.

States sponsor crimes and support terrorist to be able to use them when needed for their purpose.\n* **Counterfeit Currency:** It involves directly printing and circulating fake currency in the market. Alternatively, this is a tool used by neighbouring states to destabilize the Indian economy.\n* **Organised Crime:** Criminal organizations generally work in nexus and are often connected to bigger terrorist groups. The flow of resources is two-ways between these two.\n* **Extortion:** This remains the biggest source of funding of terrorism in India especially in the North-East.\n* **Hawala System:** This is an illegal method of transferring money, generally through international borders that is used by criminal networks.\n\n**Efforts to curtail sources**\n\n* **National Investigation Agency (NIA):** It is the premier agency in India for combating terror across states without special permission from the states.\n* **Unlawful Activities Prevention Act:** This anti-terror legislation seeks to designate an individual as a \u201cterrorist\u201d.\n* **National Intelligence Grid (NATGRID):** It is a centralised data library of terror and crime related information.\n* **SAMADHAN Doctrine:** Developed specifically for the Left-Wing Extremism problems, it also aims to curb the access of terror organizations to funds.\n\nRecently, the third No Money for Terror (NMFT) Ministerial Conference on Counter-Terrorism Financing was held in New Delhi, India. It sought to:\n\n* Collaborate with countries around the world to curtail terror and extremist funding.\n* To set up a secretariat regarding the same in the country, which won't be an investigative body but operate on the concept of collaboration and cooperation.\n* To investigate new and emerging threats and methods of propagating terrorism.\n\nBeing surrounded by two hostile neighbours does not allow India any leeway for complacent behaviour on the question of internal security.
